            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And by how much any VVriter ſeekes the applauſe of men in publiſhing his workes, by ſo much the Righteous God makes him a looſer. And that worke (moſtly) is moſt proſperous, wherein least of fame, and most of conſcience is ſought and aimed at. This poore Treatiſe of mine, though meane for phraſe, ſtyle, and artifice, yet needfull in theſe times of
<pb facs="tcp:125778:5"/>ſchiſme, and hereſie for the ſubject matter thereof, as that which may occaſion my faithfull brethren (more able) to cruſh the inſolencies of a dangerous faction, the daughter of the Separation, and the Mother of Libertiniſme. As for my call to this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were nere unto my dwelling a company of the Separation, who under tooke to erect a Church by entring into a Covenant, and theſe carried on their reſolutions hand-ſmooth, untill they were grown into a great faction. And (as it is the property of that Schiſme to ſpeake at randome) they began to let flie againſt the Church aſſemblies of England, as falſe, Antichristian, and out of Gods way.</p>
            <p>VVhereupon I began to enquire into the nature of their Covenant, and told them, that if it were a Covenant of first entrance into the true viſible Church of Christ, then of neceſsity the parties ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring muſt have the ſeale of first entrance imprinted upon them, which (under the Goſpell) is Baptiſme. For if the Ministery which they leave be falſe in the very constitution thereof, then the Sacraments by them administred, must needs be nullities; and ſo now they having a lawfull miniſtery conſtituted and ſet in Chriſts way, they muſt begin all anew, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and all. Thus (by way of arguing) I ſpake unto
<pb facs="tcp:125778:5"/>diverſe of them, which did ſo puzzle them, that not long after ſome of them fell upon this practice of ſealing their covenant by Baptiſme, renouncing their Baptiſme in their infancy, as a nullity and an Idoll. and being demanded by the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> (before whom they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented) who it was that adviſed them unto this practice, they nominated mee to be the firſt that put them upon it: whereas I was ſo farre from it, that I held that the dangerous Covenant of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would neceſſarily lead unto this. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over one <hi>Walter Coles</hi> of Painſewicke a Taylor (a man of good behaviour a long time, and well eſteemed by the godly and beſt Chriſtians) This man (I ſay) fell off firſt to the Separation, (where he had his bane.) And God having given him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther child, he refuſed to have it baptized untill it could anſwer for it ſelfe. This matter fell into debate in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wels</hi> his Congregation at <hi>Whaddon,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to the Separation there, where the ſaid <hi>Coles</hi> was a member. Now <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wels</hi> and the Church-officers of his diviſion (foreſeeing the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this buſineſſe) had reſolved to determine againſt the ſaid <hi>Walter:</hi> but this being perceived by the ſaid <hi>Coles,</hi> he deſired to goe out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<pb facs="tcp:125778:6"/>And happy had it beene for him, if hee had returned to his former godly, and profitable courſes of doing good. But he goes further, and turnes plaine Anabaptiſt. And ſo making a journey to London hee brings downe one <hi>Thomas Lambe</hi> a chandler (as it is reported) and one <hi>Clem: Writer</hi> a Factor in Blackwell-hall London (both Anabaptiſts) into this Countrey. And I being in London, theſe two travellors (by <hi>Walter Coles</hi> his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) came on the Lords-day to <hi>Cranham</hi> (where I did and doe ſerve in the worke of the Miniſtery) and there the ſaid <hi>Lamb</hi> (being in a grey-ſuit) offers to preach in publike, but being diſappointed by Gods good providence of his wicked purpoſe, he retires to a private houſe in <hi>Cranham</hi> aboveſaid, and by Preaching there he ſubverted many And ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in an extreame cold, and frosty time, in the night ſeaſon, diverſe men and women were rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the great river of <hi>Severne</hi> in the City of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> And ſo at length returning from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I found the face of things much altered, and many ſtrangely leaning to the hereſie of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. And they put on the buſineſſe with ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory boldneſſe, as if all the world had beene unable to gain-ſay their practice, or refute their
<pb facs="tcp:125778:6"/>doctrine. VVhereupon to clear my ſelfe, and to ſatisfie others, I undertooke the controverſie at <hi>Cranham,</hi> where they had left their poyſon. And when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke it, the Anabaptiſts from <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and <hi>Painſwicke</hi> came to heare mee, and ſet upon mee in the open face of the Congregation, as ſoone as I came downe out of the Pulpit. I deſired them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare publique tumults, and to ſend in their excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against what I had laid downe for Poedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. And at firſt they ſent mee in a paper with no hand to it: but this I rejected, and delivered back to them againe, becauſe I knew no one of them would stand to it, when once the folly thereof was declared. At length I received about two ſheetes of paper, and yet (though it came in the names of them all) there was but one hand unto the ſame, and this Champion doth ſo ſtoutly mannage the matter, that ſurely if his cauſe were ſuitable to his stomacke, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men nor Angels could stand before him. It is high time then for us to beſtirre our ſelves, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned hereſies ſhall find ſuch bold abettours, and that in the Land of light and truth. The Lord put it into the heats of our Parliament to ſettle a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among us with ſpeed, that out-facing impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie may be called to an account, that truth and
<pb facs="tcp:125778:7"/>peace may dwell in our Land. And now (Gentle Reader) peruſe the enſuing tractate, wherein if thou find any benefit, give God the glory, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford mee thy help at the Throne of Grace. And ſo I have done, and do thou begin.</p>

            <p>This whole Chapter contains the Hiſtory of our Saviours reſurrection, and a Rehearſall of what He did on earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the time of His triumphant reſurrection, and His glorious Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>The former we omit for brevities ſake. In the latter, the Spirit of God relates how Chriſt (being riſen from the dead, &amp; by vertue of His reſurrection poſſeſſed of all power and authority over all things and perſons, in heaven and in earth) gave a command, and commiſſion unto his Apoſtles to goe out among the Pagan-Gentiles, and plant the Goſpell among them, and not confine themſelves any longer within the precincts of <hi>Iudea.</hi> And why? Becauſe all power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Chriſt in heaven and in earth, which before was not given unto him. This is our Saviours preface, and it is a materiall paſſage, and the ground of our Saviours ſending of His Apoſtles to plant the Goſpell among the Pagan-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Now all power and authority concerning the Church of God was conferred on Him for miniſtring the kingdome of heaven among Jewes, and Gentiles. And hence obſerve this point for your inſtruction.</p>

            <p>And let this ſuffice for the Preface. Wee are now to treat of Chriſts glorious Commiſſion unto His Legates and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Wherein before we come unto the particular ſcanning of the whole text, we will premiſe two things in Generall, which will appoſitely reach the preſent controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and the Anabaptiſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Generall is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtles, and firſt planters of the Goſpell muſt no longer keep within the precincts, and borders of <hi>Iudea,</hi> but goe out among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan-Gentiles, and inſtruct them in the Myſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and ſo ſeale them alſo into Gods peculiar by baptiſme.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Generall is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtles had a Commiſſion from Chriſt to goe unto all Nations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitaion, and were not to take up their ſetled reſidence in any one Nation, but to travell from Countrey to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, their Commiſſion was ſo large and ample. They were for <hi>Spaine,</hi> they were for <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>Italy,</hi> for <hi>Corinth,</hi> for <hi>Aſia,</hi> for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> for <hi>Philippi,</hi> &amp;c. And in this they had a peculiar Commiſſion, which was to plant foundations where Chriſt was not named, to beare the Name of Chriſt before lewes and Gentiles, to be the immediate pen-men of the Holy Ghoſt, to deliver unto them the immediate will of God concerning faith and worſhip, and to confirme their doctrine by miracles, as part of their extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Now let the Anabaptiſts ſhew us any ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion among all the mopping apes of their Apoſtolicall inſtructers, by whoſe miraculous endowments, they hope to ſee all the world brought to the obedience of their faith.</p>
            <p>Now this ſecond obſervation we ſhall not ſpeak of here in this treatiſe; for ſuch was the impetuous madneſſe of the Anabaptiſts at their firſt entrance into their new way, (for young beginners are moſt fiery) that I thought it prudence, to forbear the further proſecuting of this text: for their obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions would have been ſo many, that in anſwering of them, I ſhould have ſpent whole ſermons, and ſo have deprived
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125778:9"/>mine auditory of more neceſſary inſtructions; and therefore I reſolved to deale with them by writing, and to publiſh my Sermon-notes (or at leaſt the ſumme of them) upon this firſt Generall; this being the very hinge, upon which the controverſy betwixt us, and the Anabaptiſts is turned.</p>
            <p>The firſt Generall point then is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and firſt planters of the Goſpell, were no longer to keep within the borders, and precincts of <hi>Judea,</hi> but to goe out among the Pagan-Gentiles, and inſtruct them in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpell, and being ſo inſtructed to ſeale them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods peculiar by Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Now as this point ſtands clearely upon the text, ſo other Scriptures ſuffrage with it, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.14, 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 38. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.47, 48. And this primitive adminiſtration of the Goſpell, unto the Pagan. Gentiles is called a bearing of Chriſts name before them. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15. And an opening of a doore of faith unto the Gentiles. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. And here faith muſt be the doore of admittance.</p>
            <p>But to make briefe way to the clearing of the truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the obſtreperous clamours, and darkening cavillations of the Anabaptiſts, or oppoſers of paedo-baptiſme, we are to conſider, what the ſtate of the Gentiles was in point of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, before the Goſpell was preached among them by the Apoſtles, and firſt planters of Chriſts Kingdome, and then what their eſtate is now (where the Goſpell is planted and they baptized) in point of Religion.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the Pagan-Gentiles in point of religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpell was planted among them, may be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto you in two Generalls. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They were without Chriſt, aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12.</item>
               <item>2. They had their viſible and Country-Idols, and they were carried away to dumbe Idols, even as they were led. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.2, 8. Thus the <hi>Sidoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had their <hi>Aſtaroth,</hi> the <hi>Moabites</hi> their <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125778:10"/>children of <hi>Ammon</hi> their <hi>Milchom.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. The Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines their <hi>Dagon.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1, 2. The <hi>Epheſians</hi> their <hi>Diana. Act.</hi> 19. And the <hi>Athenians</hi> their <hi>Hotch potch.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This was their ſtate in point of religion. And therefore is there any reaſon, that theſe ſhould be baptized, before they were turned from their Idols, and called to faith in Chriſt, and repentance towards God? Surely none. And therefore Chriſt would that ſuch ſhould be firſt made Diſciples, before they ſhould be baptized into the name of the ſacred Trinity. And the Apoſtles did ſo. For its expreſſely ſaid, that many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hearing, beleeved, and were baptized. And there is good reaſon for this; for</p>
            <p>Firſt, its fit that meere aliens, and profeſſed Idolaters, (Gods profeſſed enemies) ſhould manifeſt their faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before they ſhould be ſealed into Gods peculiar by baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, none of their kindred were ever before in the ſtate of Chriſtianity, from whence they might claime right unto Gods ſeale of Admittance. But now a Church was to be raiſed of perſons growne up to yeares, and ſo confeſſion of faith muſt be the ground of their baptiſme, their parents being not baptized before, and in the ſtate of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But ſecondly, the condition of the Gentiles where the Goſpell is embraced, and they baptized into the Name of the holy Trinity, is not now the ſame in point of religion. For</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Firſt, it cannot be ſaid that ſuch Gentiles are aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> without Chriſt, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</item>
               <item>2. It cannot be ſaid that ſuch Gentiles have their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Idols, by which they are carried away, ſeeing they are turned from them. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9.</item>
               <item>3. It muſt needs be acknowledged that ſuch Gentiles are not farre off, but in Jeſus Chriſt made nigh by the blood of Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. having acceſſe unto the Father
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125778:10"/>through Chriſt by the Spirit, verſe 18.</item>
               <item>4. It muſt needs be acknowledged, that ſuch Gentiles are no more ſtrangers, and forreiners, but fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, and are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe being the chiefe corner-ſtone. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20.</item>
               <item>5. It muſt needs be acknowledged, that ſuch Gentiles are all baptized into Chriſts body. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27, 28, 29. Now bring me any ſuch Gentiles as theſe, among the Pagan-Gentiles, before the Goſpell came among them, and was embraced by them. And therefore theſe things being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, who but a ſtupid dolt, and perverſe wrangler, can hence conclude, that infants of Chriſtian parents ſhould bee debarred from the Sacrament of Baptiſme in their infancy. And the reaſon is becauſe their parents are not now found in the ſtate of heatheniſh Paganiſme, (as were thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom Chriſt ſent His Apoſtles before they received Chriſt and His Goſpell) but now they ſtand in Grace, and Covenant with God, as His peculiar people, holy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now, albeit it is a truth, that all children of baptized pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are baptizable, and to be baptized, yet to prevent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, and all collaterall cavillations, I propound the queſtion concerning paedo-baptiſme in theſe termes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether children of holyeſt parents in pureſt Churches are to be baptized in their infancy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The point between us and the compleat Anabaptiſts is ſimply concerning paedo-baptiſme. If my controverſy lay with the Semi-Anabaptiſts, I would lay my propoſition in other termes, but the compleat Anabaptiſt doth hold, that no child in infancy is baptizable, let his parents be never ſo holy, and let the adminiſtration be never ſo pure.</p>
            <p>Now we maintaine the affirmative of this queſtion againſt the Anabaptiſts upon theſe grounds; <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> I but, ſay our buſy-Anabaptiſts, there was a viſible manifeſtation of the holy Ghoſt in a miraculous manner, up-thoſe that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of there; but there is no manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt, upon Infants of Chriſtian parents in their infancy, more then upon Infants of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, that there was a manifeſtation of the Holy Ghoſt, as well to the eye of ſenſe, as to the eye of faith, but here to the eye of faith only. That was miraculous &amp; extra or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; this oraculous &amp; ordinary. And a ſtanding Oracle is as much to be credited; as a Miracle, if not more; For miracles are but ſecondary confirmations of divine faith, but Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Oracles are primary. Manifeſtations of holineſſe may be fallacious, but Gods Oracles are certain, and can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And the ſinger of God hath written holineſſe upon Infants of Chriſtians, and <hi>Paul</hi> (Gods Embaſſadour) hath proclaimed it unto us. A writing, and a proclamation, that the heiliſh ſpite, and virulent tongues of clamouring Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, ſhall never be able to obliterate or diſanull by their baſtard expoſition of this ſacred Oracle; forcing it to ſpeak the ſtrange language of a ſeduced Anabaptiſt, and not the heavenly language of the ſacred Scriptures, a practiſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diabolicall and helliſh. But put caſe (oh monſter) that God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the Holy Ghoſt ſhould come unto thee, and ſay, theſe are holy children. Doeſt thou think Gods meaning were, that they are no ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, but lawfully begotten? Surely, if that ſhould be Gods meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſhould not ſpeak according to the uſuall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his owne written word. For tell me, where God termes children holy, for their being meer legitimates? Canſt thou bring one text of Scripture, where children are ſaid to be holy, unleſſe it be in relation unto the holy Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they were borne? And if God ſhould ſay that ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:125778:11"/>children are holy, becauſe of the holy Covenant, under which they were borne, (as children are ſaid to be holy for that only reaſon in the Scripture.) Did not God in this ſay unto thee, I have ſet theſe children apart unto my ſelfe? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. Did not God in ſo ſaying ſay unto thee, ſet them a part unto Me as My Portion. And how wouldeſt thou ſet them apart unto God, but by putting Gods ſeale upon them? Well, we need not ſuppoſe Gods ſpeaking thus unto thee, for God doth ſo ſpeak unto thee, and unto all men in this ſacred Oracle. And on children of Chriſtian parents it muſt ſtand, as an unchangeable Oracle, that they are holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But (ſay Anabaptiſts) that children of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are holy, the text is expreſſely cleare; but what holineſſe doth the Apoſtle meane?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, that doubtleſſe the Apoſtle meanes ſuch holineſſe as the Prophets in the old Teſtament doe meane, when they call the children of Gods Covenant-people the holy ſeed. Not holineſſe by legitimation, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Jeſuite, and his diſciples the Anabaptiſts dreame, but ſuch holineſſe as hath the promiſe of the kingdome of heaven. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.13, 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13, 14, 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.</p>

And infants are no where in Scripture phraſed holy, but in relation to the holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, under which they were borne.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Secondly, Infants of Chriſtians are to be baptized in their infancie, becauſe they are ſubjects capable of it. Now that they are ſubjects capable of this initiall ſeale in their infancie, appeares conſpicuouſly by Gods expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the infants of Jews, &amp; their proſelytes ſhould be circumciſed in their infancie. If they had not beene ſubject a capable of it, God would not have commanded it, but God did command it, and therefore they were ſubjects capable of it. And theſe infants were not therefore capable, becauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:125778:13"/>of Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and their Fathers, which were ſealed unto God by Circumciſion, and in Covenant with him. For the Text ſaith not, Thou ſhalt keepe My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand therefore, but <hi>thou ſhalt keepe My Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations, Gen.</hi> 17.9. implying, that this command had reference to the Covenant, and was part of it. For here God is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as God in covenant with His people, and all his commands are branches of His Covenant, all grounded upon His free grace in Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore in the next verſe, (<hi>viz. v.</hi> 10.) Hee calls Circumciſion by the name of His Covenant, ſaying, <hi>This is my Covenant, which ye ſhall keepe betweene Mee and you, and thy ſeed after thee: every man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> And to put the matter out of all doubt, that Circumciſion is called by the name of the Covenant, the Lord ſpeakes expreſly afterwards, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>And My Covenant ſhall be in your fleſh, v.</hi> 13. to teach us that the Covenant made infants capable of the ſeale, and not Gods meere <hi>Mandamus,</hi> as our abſtracting Anabaptiſts play with notions. And ſo they will conſider God here in His abſolute prerogative, and not as in Covenant with this people. Whereas the Seale can be nothing, but a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſes of Grace unto ſuch as have the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made unto them. So then the promiſes of grace made theſe infants capable of having the promiſes confirmed unto them by Gods initiall ſeale. Now what ſeale ſhould be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique in Heaven, and ſeale up divine promiſes unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under the promiſes, or in covenant with God, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon Gods inſtitution. Now God inſtituted Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and commanded it to be imprinted on the fleſh of his people in covenant, as the proper ſubjects capable of the ſame. So that the command that the Anabaptiſts talke of ſo much, are the words of inſtitution, it being Gods prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative incommunicable to inſtitute Sacramentall ſignes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He onely can make them effectuall to ſupernaturall ends, and give the things ſignified thereby.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:125778:13"/>
            <p>Now Circumciſion did bind the circumciſed to the obedience of the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. And this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was laid on very Infants before they could have any knowledge of the Law.</p>
            <p>And againe, Circumciſion is a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith in the <hi>Meſſias, Rom.</hi> 4.11. And this ſeale was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on very infants, before they could have any actuall faith or knowledge of righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>And unto this obedience and faith, the Covenant (under which they were borne) had bound them, though the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ſeale had beene denyed them. Such an Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call wickedneſſe could not have put theſe infants into the condition of aliens. The Covenant it ſelfe would have bound them to faith and obedience. And the Covenant it ſelfe would have made them capable of Gods ſaving mercy, though the initiall ſeale had beene denyed them. Such an <hi>Anabaptiſticall cruelty</hi> could not have blockt up heaven againſt them. Conſider this you ſtout Champions for Hell, which do what in you lyes to make Gods Covenant of free grace void, and of none effect unto his people. And to ſtop the courſe of Gods mercy unto the ſoules of men.</p>
            <p>Well, the being of infants in covenant under the Law made them capable of Circumciſion, the initiall ſeale of the Covenant. To be in covenant then with God makes a man capable of the initiall ſeale in infancie, according to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Chriſt, under which he is borne, <hi>i.e.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the miniſtration be of Chriſt to be exhibited in the fleſh, or of Chriſt already exhibited in the fleſh. The ſubſtance is the ſame. The Covenant is nothing but Chriſt miniſtred. Whether it be mans Saviour to come, that is miniſtred (as to the Jewes and their proſelytes in types) or mans Saviour already come be miniſtred (as to Chriſtians without types in cleare demonſtrations) in the ordinances of Grace, yet it is the ſame Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>The ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13.9. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> In the Ordinances of Grace in times paſt, preſent and to

            </list>
            <p>Onely Gods manner of miniſtring Chriſt unto man for his eternall ſalvation is diverſe, according to the diverſitie of Chriſt ſtate: <hi>viz.</hi> as not incarnate, and to come; or incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and already come; and ſo the miniſtration is diverſe in the Ordinances of Grace.</p>
            <p>Before Chriſt was come in the fleſh all the Ordinances of Grace directed the eyes of the faithfull unto Chriſt to be exhibited for their ſalvation &amp; redemption. (And therefore all the Ordinances of grace muſt needs be typicall) And this did quiet their conſciences, and filled their hearts with joy.</p>
            <p>And ſince Chriſt is come, all the Ordinances of Grace, ſerve to confirme the faithfull in this point, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Chriſt exhibited (in the fleſh) unto us. And this cauſes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:125778:14"/>us to reſt in Him for Redemption, and ſalvation, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other Saviour.</p>
            <p>Now if Infants under the typicall miniſtration of Chriſt were capable of the initiall ſeale of this Covenant (becauſe borne under this Covenant) in their very infancie, when they could declare no right they had unto it, but their birth; then Infants of Chriſtians under the Goſpel, borne under the ſame Covenant of Grace, are capable of the preſent initiall ſeale of this Covenant, though they can ſhew no right they have unto it, but their being born of ſuch parents as are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The manifeſtation of faith is no more requiſite to the adminiſtration of Baptiſme unto ſuch as are borne Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than it was to the adminiſtration of Circumciſion unto ſuch as were born Jews. But as ſuch as were made Jewes had Circumciſion adminiſtred unto them, becauſe they teſtified faith in the Meſſias, and ſuch as were borne Jewes had it by birth, as children of parents in covenant. So ſuch as are made Chriſtians are to have Baptiſme miniſtred unto them, upon the teſtimony of their faith, but ſuch as are borne Chriſtians are to have it by birth, as children of parents in Covenant with God, and of his houſhold and family. For as it was a rule of old, that <hi>nemo circumcidendus quà Infans,</hi> or, <hi>quà adultus,</hi> but <hi>quatenus foederatus.</hi> So now, <hi>nemo baptizandus quà infans,</hi> or <hi>quà adultus,</hi> but <hi>quatenus foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratus.</hi> Now if infants of Chriſtians appeare unto us to be <hi>foederati</hi> (as they do) then we are to adminiſter baptiſme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in their infancie. Baptiſme herein anſwering to Circumciſion. And ſo the fond quaere of the Anabaptiſts is groundleſſe. What (ſay they) ſhall we ſeale a blanke? But this queſtion implies this blaſphemie, namely, that Gods written Covenant is a blanke, for Gods covenant is written upon the children of parents in covenant, as Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are in covenant. And if ſo, then their infants are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, otherwiſe the parents are not in covenant. For though it follows not, children are in covenant with God, therefore their parents are in covenant with God, for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:125778:15"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> was in covenant with God, but his father <hi>Terah</hi> was not: yet it follows undeniably, parents are in Covenant with God, therfore their Infants are in Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>Now then the Infants of Chriſtian parents have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, written upon them by birth, becauſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch parents. And becauſe their being in Covenant in their infancy appeares unto the Church, therefore the Church is to baptize them in their infancy; for when perſons appeare unto the Church to be in Gods Covenant of Grace, then the Church is to put the Covenant under ſeale unto them; and tis their due, and the Churches duty.</p>
            <p>And ſo in the buſineſſe of paedo-baptiſme, wee are not to looke to the righteouſneſſe inherent in the parents, nor to the righteouſneſſe in the infant (for of neither of theſe can we have certaine, and infallible knowledge) but to the righteouſneſſe of the Covenant, or to the free grace of God in Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. where Circumciſion is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith; And therefore the ſeale of imputative righteouſneſſe. And hence is the groſſe miſtake of our Anabaptiſts. They thinke that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Baptiſme is grounded on the practicall righteouſneſſe of the creature, manifeſted in words or works, (which ſtinkes of Popery all over) but orthodox Chriſtians in the buſineſſe of paedo-baptiſme doe look to Gods Covenant of free Grace, and ſo preſent their children unto Gods mercy, and Fatherly love in Jeſus Chriſt, our Righteouſneſſe, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and attonement.</p>
            <p>And albeit our infants have no inherent righteouſneſſe manifeſted unto us by their words or actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet God hath righteouſneſſe to be imputed, by vertue of His Covenant of Grace (ſaying, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of their ſeed in their generations</hi>) And therefore we dedicate our children unto God in their infancy by Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Now our Popiſh Anabaptiſts cannot endure to heare of Circumciſion, as if that ſhould be to the Jewes before Chriſts incarnation, the ſame with baptiſme unto Chriſtians ſince.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125778:15"/>Oh they labour to cry downe this, as the groſſeſt abſurdity, that ever was uttered by the tongues of men. But this is no new thing, for the old heretiques heretofore did lead upſtart punies in the right way, how to faſten themſelves to their owne errors, and Popiſh pride.</p>
            <p>But I pray what difference between theſe two, ſave in the outward ceremony? For was not Circumciſion as ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of entrance into the true Church of God before Chriſts incarnation? And is not Baptiſme the ſame unto us Chriſtians ſince Chriſts Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>Why doth the Apoſtle call baptized Chriſtians, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Chriſtians, and Baptiſme by the name of Circumciſion? <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 14.</p>
            <p>Was not Circumciſion a ſeale of the ſame juſtifying faith, as Baptiſme is now unto us? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p>And in a word, did not Circumciſion ſignifie the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the fleſh, and the renewing of the mind, and ſo bind over the Jewes unto the obedience of Gods will? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. And doth not Baptiſme the ſame now? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>Now ſhew us any ſubſtantiall difference between theſe two Sacraments; for if there bee no ſubſtantiall difference, then without controverſy there is a ſubſtantiall union. You ſay, there is a wide difference, for the one was the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of the fore-skin of the fleſh, and the other is a waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with water. So ſay we, but this difference is but ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; but as an initiall ſeale, how differ they, or in any other ſpirituall effect neceſſary unto ſalvation? When we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sacraments, we doe not look upon them by <hi>halves,</hi> as you Anabaptiſts doe, and detaine our ſenſes in the <hi>bodily part</hi> of them. We look upon the myſticall part of them, as they are of ſpirituall uſe to confirm the Covenant of Grace, and to further a man in the way to Heaven. And ſo circumciſion was that unto the Jewes before Chriſts incarnation, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is to Chriſtians ſince.</p>
            <p>Now to overthrow this, Anabaptiſts uſually alleadge two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:125778:16"/>
            <p>Firſt, they alleadge that Baptiſme cannot be the ſame unto Chriſtians ſince Chriſts incarnation, as Circumciſion was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jewes before, and why? Becauſe (ſay they) Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was to be adminiſtred unto Infants, on the eighth day, but Baptiſme is not to bee adminiſtred unto Infants on the eight day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> This objection proves nothing againſt the point in hand, for the eighth day fell out to bee in ſuch a time, wherein the Infants could make no ſacramentall uſe of the Sacrament of Circumciſion, and they were a blanke in their ſenſe, as much as our Infants. Under the law they were to be kept from Circumciſion untill the eight day for a ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſon. <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.2, 3. And this makes nothing at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what we have ſaid, touching the ſubſtantiall identity of Circumciſion and Baptiſme. For things that doe differ circumſtantially, may yet be altogether one in ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they alleadge that under the law females were not circumciſed, but under the Goſpell they are baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> We anſwer, that this (neither) makes nothing againſt the point in hand, which is paedo-baptiſme; for grant that the proportion holds between Circumciſion and Baptiſme, were it but in males, this were enough to refute their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. For this would inferre that the ſtate of infancy doth not make perſons uncapable of the initiall ſeale of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace under the Goſpell. But they oppoſe paedo-baptiſme in males and females. But we anſwer that under the law the females were circumciſed in the males, as the Church is circumciſed in Chriſt. The males bearing the type of Chriſt upon their fleſh, and the males and females in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall conjunction repreſenting Chriſt and His Church. And unto this the Apoſtle alludes. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.22, 33. And now ſuch a typicall diſcrimination of ſexes being removed, Chriſt exhibited puts no difference in Baptiſme between males and females. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27, 28. So then the argument ſtands good, that Infants are capable of Baptiſme, becauſe borne under the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:125778:16"/>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> Thirdly, Infants of Chriſtians are to be baptized in their infancy, becauſe we have divine warrant for it. For the text here (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.) imports, that all the children of the Chriſtian Church are to be baptized. And Gods Covenant of grace with the parents, put under ſeale unto them by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, doth neceſſarily put the Infants of ſuch parents under the ſame Covenant of grace; as the ſeed of ſuch parents. For to grant, that baptized parents are put under the Covenant of grace by divine warrant, is to grant that the children of ſuch parents are put under the ſame Covenant, by the ſame warrant. For the ſeparating of Children from parents in Covenant is to diſſolve that Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the promiſed ſeed, for the eternall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jewes and Gentiles. Now the very being of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents under the ſeale of this Covenant doth prove unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, that their infants are in this Covenant. And if this proves the being of Infants in Covenant, then it proves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably their right of having the Covenant put under ſeale unto them by divine warrant, and ſo (by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence) their divine right unto Baptiſme. For by birth they are in the Covenant, becauſe borne under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as children of ſuch parents. And admit the parents unto Baptiſme upon the teſtimony of their faith, and that brings the children of ſuch parents into the Church by birth; ſo then baptize the parents, and thereby of neceſſity you make the Infants of ſuch parents baptizable by divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and it cannot be avoyded.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. doth warrant our baptizing of Infants whoſe parents are baptized, may thus be evinced and made good; <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Now the contradictory of this Minor propoſition is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Infants of baptized parents are not true members of the Chriſtian Church.

               <item>Infants of baptized parents are either true members of the Chriſtian Church, or elſe they are Aliens, Pagans, and Infidels; there is no <hi>medium,</hi> there is no <hi>neuter.</hi>

            <p> And ſo by neceſſary conſequence Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. is a divine warrant, for the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Infants, whoſe parents are baptized. Now let the Anabaptiſts ſhew us any child, or infant of baptized parents, that is not a true member of the Chriſtian Church, and prove him by the word of God to be no member of the Chriſtian Church, and we will not baptize that child.</p>
            <p>Again, to contrive my Syllogiſme in another mood, which may as well accompliſh my purpoſe, and prove that Chriſts Commiſſion for baptizing, is for the baptizing of Infants whoſe parents are baptized, as well as for the baptizing of the alien upon the teſtimony of his faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus I argue, <hi>viz.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>Now that ſome Infants of Chriſtians are true members of the Chriſtian Church may thus be proved; <hi>viz.</hi>

            <list>

            <p>Now then if Chriſts Commiſſion <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. be, that we ſhould baptize all true members of the Chriſtian Church; and that ſome Infants are true members of the Chriſtian Church, then ſome Infants of Chriſtian parents are to be baptized by vertue of Chriſts Commiſſion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. And this proves that perſons may be baptizable in their infancy, and ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p>And as for what you inſtance from the practiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that will not ſerve your turne. For the Apoſtolicall Miniſtery lay, in gathering of a primitive Church from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme and Paganiſme. But inſtance in the practiſe of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paſtours in a Church gathered (as the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> or any other mentioned in the new Teſtament) and bring me thence but one inſtance, that any children (whoſe parents were baptized, and in the ſtate of Chriſtianity) were held back from baptiſme, untill they could give an accompt of their faith in perſon, and then you will ſpeak to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition of Gods Church in theſe times. But this you cannot doe, and therefore in drawing extraordinary inſtances into an ordinary canon, to binde all the Churches of God unto like practiſe, is to overthrow the nature of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and to make that a perſonall Covenant (<hi>i. e.</hi> to terminate in the perſon baptized) which God hath made ſociall, <hi>i. e.</hi> to beleevers and their ſeed jointly ſaying, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for this Commiſſion in the 28. of <hi>Matth.</hi> verſe 19, 20. Its a full, and univerfall Commiſſion, belonging to all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:125778:18"/>the Miniſters of Chriſt under the Goſpell, unto the worlds end. And of theſe Miniſters, ſome are extraordinary, and to ceaſe; and ſome are ordinary, and to continue. So then in this ſhort Commiſſion, here is ſomewhat Apoſtolicall, and peculiar to extraordinary Miniſters, which cannot be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, nor expected from ordinary paſtours in ſetled Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; As to plant foundations, to work miracles, as proofes of their immediate calling from God, to be led by an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirit in delivering immediate oracles from Chriſt, as ſtanding canons of divine faith, and worſhip, &amp;c. And ſo their practiſe was extraordinary, and no ſuch thing is to be expected from ordinary paſtours, but to build upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which the Apoſtles laid. Now the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Churches gathered unto ordinary paſtours and teachers, which muſt proceed in the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, where the Apoſtles left, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c. And that this is ſuch an univerſall Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as we ſpeak of) the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes cleare, and puts it out of all doubt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 13. where he expoundes the meaning of this Commiſſion. For whereas Chriſt in this text (here) ſaith <hi>All power is given unto Me, goe yee therefore and teach all Nations &amp;c. Paul</hi> upon the ſame ground and occaſion ſaith, <hi>when He aſcended up on high</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men, &amp;c. And He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome paſtours, and teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> For how long? <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the end of the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, ſayes Paul.</hi> See then what confuſion the Anabaptiſts doe ſpeak, when they urge from this text Apoſtolicall imitation in ordinary paſtours, without diſtinguiſhing of what is herein peculiar to extraordinary Miniſters, and what is common to Apoſtles and ordinary paſtours. This I thought good to ſpeak, to prevent a miſchiefe that might befall unſtable ſoules (through
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:125778:18"/>the jugling fraud cunning craftineſſe of the Anabaptiſts) for want of a right underſtanding of our Saviours mind in this text. For they will hence take occaſion to cry up Chriſts Commiſſion unto His Apoſtles in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>viz.</hi> of making men Diſciples, before they could bee capable of Baptiſme, putting no difference between thoſe that are to be made Chriſtians of Aliens, and thoſe that are borne Chriſtians of Chriſtians; and alſo putting no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Apoſtolicall miniſtration and the Paſtorall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and ſo by a confuſed urging of the text in the ſtrict letter, they ſeduce many an unſtable ſoule unto their hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call practiſe of rebaptizing. Whereas could they but look upon this Commiſſion, as an univerſall Commiſſion, they would ſoone diſcerne the fraud of theſe men, and would not bee carried away by them. Chriſtians then in theſe dayes ſhould labour, to be men in knowledge, and not <hi>bee alwayes children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lye in waite to deceive. Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. Seducers have a ſleight, whereby they can deceive children <hi>i. e.</hi> men of little knowledge in divine myſteries, and of an unſtable and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering mind. Theſe ſeducers can uſe the Scriptures, as the juglers uſe their dice. For as the jugler hath a ſleight to make his dice to turne up what may ſerve his turne, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud ſuch as he playes withall, ſo ſeducers have a ſleight (when they deale with men of little knowledge and of a wavering minde) to make the Scriptures ſpeak their owne language, for to winne men unto their party. And the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor is here by the Apoſtle taken from the jugler, for hee ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Men deceive novices and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Chriſtians. But how? <hi>In the dice-playing of men.</hi> And ſo our Anabaptiſts meeting with Novices and ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded chriſtians, will make this and other Scriptures ſpeak their own principles and language, to deceive men and lead them into error. And therefore I thought good to acquaint you with the true meaning of this text, which the jugling Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts pervert to their own ends, and doe not make it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:125778:19"/>ſpeak the mind of Chriſt, but the language of their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and ſeducing hearts. and tis blaſphemy to ſay that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny text of Scripture doth ſpeak their helliſh principles. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones may be carried away with their good words and faire ſpeeches, but grounded Chriſtians know, and ſee their juglings and method of deceiving well enough. The text warrants and commands the baptizing of all true members of the Chriſtian Church. And therefore it warrants the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants of baptized parents: and this Inference can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoyded. And ſo much for this third reaſon for pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do baptiſme.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> Fourthly, we baptize Infants of baptized parents, becauſe the Lord doth ordinarily make our baptizing of Infants effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to the proper ends, whereunto true Baptiſme is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Now the ends are, to put on Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. To dye unto ſinne, and to live unto God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. And God doth ordinarily make Baptiſme effectuall unto theſe ends, in perſons that were baptized in their infancy.</p>
            <p>For among thoſe that were baptized in their infancy wee have as humble, meek, and mortified Chriſtians, (men and women) as any among the Anabaptiſts, to ſay no more. We have thoſe that dye dayly unto ſinne, and are vexed in ſoule to ſee the abominations of others. Againe wee have thoſe that beare upon them the markes of the Lord Jeſus. Their lives are holy and lovely. They are ſound in the faith, grave in their behaviour, and ready unto every good work. They deny themſelves, they advance free grace, they afflict their ſoules, and ſeek the peace of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ordinarily our miniſtery doth gaine them, and ſweetly winne upon them, they grow in grace, and ſubmit unto Gods word in all duties. And certainly God doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily work by a falſe miniſtery, and a falſe Sacrament. I ſay God doth not thus ordinarily by falſe and unlawfull meanes, though ſometimes He brings light out of darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now I challenge all the Browniſts, and Anabaptiſts in the world to anſwer me this one thing, though nothing bee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:125778:19"/>more rife with them, then to condemne our Miniſters and Baptiſme, as falſe and Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>Certainly God would not ordinarily give teſtimony to a falſe Miniſtery, and falſe Sacrament by making them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the proper ends, whereunto the true Miniſtery and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are appointed in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth this very argument to prove his calling to be right, and from the Lord. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1, 2. ſaying, <hi>Am I not an Apoſtle? Am I not free? Have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord? If I bee not an Apoſtle to others, yet doubtleſſe I am to you, for the ſeale of mine Apoſtleſhip, are yee in the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>5</label> Fiftly, and laſtly we baptize Infants of Chriſtian parents, becauſe it is the practiſe of other reformed Churches, which God hath bleſſed in that way with great increaſe of heavenly gifts.</p>
            <p>Now if we ſhould forbeare by virtue of a divine reſtraint, (as we pretend) then wee ſhould lay iniquity upon whole kingdomes, and godly ſocieties, as taking liberty where God hath put a reſtraint.</p>
            <p>And how ſhould we juſtifie our practiſe, and condemne theirs, by the word of God? For they would tell us, that we put reſtraint upon mens conſciences, where God hath put none. And that we miſinterpre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the 28. of <hi>Matth.</hi> verſe 19. And that our inter pretation of the text is abſurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and that neither Chriſts Commiſſion, nor the Apoſtles practiſe doth any way countenance our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, they would tell us that wee doe evade the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. againſt us, by a baſe and beggerly ſhift, plainly derogatory to the Majeſty of the holy Scriptures, in ſaying that children of a beleever are ſaid there to bee holy in oppoſition to baſtardy, as if they were holy for no other more noble cauſe, but for their being meer legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates: a notion too low for the Spirit of divine Oracles, a notion plainly ridiculous in the apprehenſion of every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary capacity, the Scriptures no where terming children ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for the holy Covenants ſake under which they were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:125778:20"/>borne. Now for us to pretend Apoſtolicall imitation, and walking according to Chriſts primitive Commiſſion, and yet to put off Apoſtolicall Authority with ſuch a baſtardly gloſſe, would give other Churches (which we oppoſe) juſt cauſe to think, that our way is rather a diabolicall deluſion, then an ordinance of Chriſt, and that phantaſticall humours doe rather ſway with us, then conſcience.</p>
            <p>Againe, they would tell us that our way of rebaptizing hath been alwayes condemned, in all reformed Churches by the holieſt and ableſt Chriſtians for an hereſie, and that paedo-baptiſme was never ſo condemned in any reformed Church, but practiſed and maintained an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt under the Goſpell, and that God ordinarily hath bleſſed it by making the ſame effectuall, to the comfort and ſanctification of the baptized.</p>
            <p>Furthermore they would tell us, that denying Baptiſme unto Infants of baptized parents is grounded upon an helliſh foundation, and is the inlet of many hatefull hereſies, which have been alwayes found with the abettours of this practiſe, though at their firſt entrance into this trade, they have not been ſo vile and loathſome. Yet for the maintaining of this way (when oppoſed by the Churches and Miniſters of Chriſt) they have been enforced to hold many groſſe and palpable hereſies, which our Anabaptiſts will be driven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, though as yet they deny not the doctrine of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, orginall ſinne in Infants, the morality of the Chriſtian Sabbath, the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. I ſay (though as yet they ſeem to be more tolerable) they muſt be driven unto theſe and many moe ſuch abominations, or elſe they cannot hold up their trade.</p>
            <p>Finally, they would produce many learned authours, that have condemned our practice, and refuted our tenents, which to this day are not anſwered, by any of the contrary party. Now for us to make ſo pitifull a ſchiſme from all the Churches of God, and not to refute thoſe that have written againſt us, would argue rather obſtinate folly, then conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and zeale.</p>

Shew where the Scripture ſo termes Infants of Chriſtian parents, ſeeing ſuch are borne Chriſtians, and called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Saints. I <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. You ſhew your ſelfe to be an open and profeſſed enemy to the holy ſeed, in caſting ſo ſoule a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon perſons, that God hath ſo highly honoured. And as much may be ſaid of the Infants of the Jewes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were borne in originall ſinne, yet the Scripture termes them no where open and profeſſed enemies to God, though you ſay the promiſes made unto them were but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary. Nor did this eſtate debarre them from being ſealed into Gods peculiar in their infancy, by the ſeale of His holy and eternall Covenant. Now if you ſay that infants in their infancy, muſt not be baptized becauſe they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of that myſticall Ordinance, nor have ſaith to apply the promiſes therein held forth; by the ſame reaſon the Infants of the Jewes ſhould not have been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, for circumciſion had in it the ſame eſſentiall myſtery with Baptiſme, though held forth in a type. And ſo your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:125778:22"/>blames God Himſelfe for prepoſterous dealing, in preſcribing the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on perſons, before they manifeſted, or could mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt any faith at all by profeſſion, or practiſe. And circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was a ſeale of the ſame righteouſneſſe of faith, which we Chriſtians build our eternall ſalvation upon, and that is faith in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But there was a ſpeciall command for circumciſion in the time of infancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> But your reaſon (I ſay) blames God for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, becauſe Infants of Jewes were as much in the ſtate of nature, as Infants of Chriſtians. So then the ſame reaſon that you alleadge to blame us for our practiſe, doth blame God for His command. Againe, we anſwer that there was ſuch a command for the circumciſing of ſuch Infants in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, whoſe parents were under Gods ſeale, but no ſuch command for Infants, whoſe parents were not. Profeſſion of faith was needfull unto ſuch whoſe parents were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods foederall ſeale. And ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> (in whom the Church of the Jewes began) had ſaith before hee had the ſeale; for being uncircumciſed (or before circumciſion) hee had the righteouſneſſe of faith. <hi>Rom</hi> 4.11. But no ſuch thing afterward required of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, but the contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, namely, that his ſeed ſhould be circumciſed in their infancy. So for baptiſme under the Goſpell: For ſuch, whoſe parents are not under the ſeale of Gods Covenant, are not to be baptized, but firſt to manifeſt the righteouſneſſe of faith. And here (as in <hi>Abraham</hi>) the righteouſneſſe of faith muſt goe before the initiall ſeale, but when parents (as <hi>Abraham</hi>) are once under the ſeale of Gods Covenant, their ſeed (as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) are to bee ſealed unto God in their infancy by vertue of their Chriſtian birth-right; for by birth they are under Gods Covenant, and that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under which they were borne is to bee put under ſeale and ratified unto them, as joint confederates with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and of Gods peculiar people with them. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:125778:22"/>words of the Covenant are I WILL BEE THY GOD, AND THE GOD OF THY SEED. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God doth put the initiall ſeale upon the parents. He doth enright the ſeed of ſuch parents unto the Covenant and initiall ſeale thereof in their infancy, as the Lord hath clearely reſolved the caſe when He put His Covenant under ſeale with <hi>Abraham.</hi> And therefore you Anabaptiſts are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of Gods Covenant, and will have it to terminate in the party baptized, and not to extend to his or her ſeed, as their Chriſtian jointure by birth. So then the Covenant that God makes with us Chriſtians is not, I will be thy God and the God of thy Seed jointly. But I will be thy God, and not the God of the ſeed, untill they manifeſt faith in practice and profeſſion, and then I will be the God of thy ſeed alſo. And ſo this Covenant will be no priviledge unto children of Chriſtian parents at all, for the children of Turkes ſhall bee received by Baptiſme, when they teſtify faith in chriſt, and and repentance towards God. And ſo Gods Covenant of Grace muſt alwayes terminate in the party baptized, and goe no further. And is not this mad Divinity, that the children ſhall be excluded, when God hath joyned parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as joint-partakers of the ſame Covenant, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? And are not you herein the devills attournies ſent of purpoſe to wrangle children of Chriſtian parents out of the ſpirituall inheritance, unto which they are borne as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by birth? The Lord plead the cauſe of His Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe perverſe diſputers, maintaine the inheritance of our ſeed and of-ſpring againſt the curſed machinations of theſe ſacrilegious theeves and robbers, which ſteale from God, from us, and from our children. But you call for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference beteeen us Chriſtians, and the Pagan-Gentiles by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; unles this be ſhewed <hi>nothing, in effect is ſpoken againſt you, or for us.</hi> By nature, that is, by naturall generation, this (I beleeve) is your meaning, a notion indeed high enough for Anabaptiſts, who look upon all Gods ordinances like ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all beaſts. But upon that naturall generation of procreation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:125778:23"/>of ſeed you may behold the Covenant of Grace eſtabliſhed, and ſet up, had you any ſparke of ſpirituall diſcerning in you. for ſo did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul. Epheſ.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And had you learned the language of the Scriptures, you might truly ſay that the children of Chriſtians are Chriſtians by nature, and not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Pagans; as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Jewes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we are Jewes by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. Here Jewes by nature, and ſinners of the Gentiles are oppoſite members. But how were they Jewes by nature? Surely, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, becauſe they were the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant, becauſe borne under the holy Covenant. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. And how were not the Jewes ſinners of the Gentiles? Surely Divines (whom you may ſeem ſooner to refute then underſtand) tell us, that ſuch as were borne Jewes had not their ſinnes imputed unto them, otherwiſe they were borne in originall ſinne as well as the Gentiles, but the holy Covenant of Grace was eſtabliſht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which Covenant was appointed as a remedy to fre e them from originall corruption, and to reſtore them to Gods favour. But this is a kind of language which you Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts haply doe not underſtand. For had you any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this way you would not reaſon ſo wildly, and turne Gods Covenant out of doores; by putting no difference by nature between ſuch as are born Chriſtians in the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the holy Covenant; and ſuch as are born Pagans, out of the Church, &amp; ſtrangers from the covenant. And therefore ſeeing by nature there is ſo wide a difference between ſuch as are born Chriſtians, and ſuch as are born Pagans, you in effect as good as ſay nothing. For God bath engraven His Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon the Infants of Chriſtians, and made this knowne unto his Church, and therefore the Infants of Chriſtians are to have the priviledge of Baptiſme in their infancy. But God hath not engraven His Covenant upon children of Pagans, therefore they are not to have it, untill they teſtify faith and repentance. And this covenant written upon children of Chriſtians in their infancy, is the Commiſſion that the Holy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:125778:23"/>Ghoſt hath given in Scripture for baptizing Infants of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their infancy. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. And now I pray put your heads all together, and let me heare what you can ſay againſt this. But goe on.</p>

And therefore the alteration of times, and ſtate is not ſufficient to alter a divine inſtitution, untill it be altered by divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by which it was at firſt commanded. As for inſtance, Suppoſe the King ſhould eſtabliſh a Law, and an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for the practiſing of any particular action, in the Land, and the cauſe may be removed, for which this Law was eſtabliſhed, yet this Act doth ſtill remaine in force to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, untill the Author thereof doth diſanull it by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or alteration.

               <p>Now let mee but prove the Minor Propoſition, and you are overthrowne irrecoverably, though you ſeeme to be armed with Law and Goſpell againſt us. Well, the point that I have to make good is this: namely, that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I here uſed, was truly deducted from the Scriptures of God. And to make this good, the very rehearſall of what I ſaid will be enough, without any more adoe. The ſumme of what I ſaid was, that the ſtate of the Pagan Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles planted the Goſpell among them, was not the ſame in point of religion, as is the ſtate of the Chriſtian- Gentiles, where the Goſpell is embraced, and they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Now I repreſented the ſtate of the Pagan-Gentiles unto you in two particulars. 1. I told you that (before the Goſpell came among the Pagan-Gentiles) they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, being aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. And I am ſure this is no humane conceipt unleſſe the Oracles of God are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conceipts. 2. I ſaid againe, that before the Goſpell came among the Pagan-Gentiles, they were carried away to dumbe Idols, even as they were led. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. Neither is this any humane conceipt. Then finally the Gentiles where the Goſpell is planted, are not of this condition in point of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:125778:24"/>religion, but in covenant with God, and of Gods family and houſhold, as you may ſee in any Sermon-notes prefixed.</p>
               <p>If this Argument doth overthrow the ſenſe that you give of <hi>Matth</hi> 28.19. then you doe not give the right ſenſe of the text. For no argument truly deducted from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can overthrow the true meaning of any Scripture. And ſo if your manner of baptizing (which you would have to be warranted by that of our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.) will not ſtand with the nature of Gods covenant of Grace, among the Gentiles, where the Goſpell is planted: then Chriſt meanes not your way of baptizing in Churches, where the Goſpell is planted. So then this argument of mine tends not to the overthrowing of any inſtitution of Chriſt in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. but layes a ground for the refuting of your wrong interpretation of the text, the true meaning of which text you may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſee in due place. For (it ſhould ſeem) this is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your ſong, and afterwards iterated againe and againe. And for me to run over the ſame things againe and againe, would argue me to be as void of mater, as you are of reaſon. But, I pray, one thing more. What are thoſe ſenſuall and groundleſſe arguments of mine, that you ſo ſleightly paſſe over, as not worth the anſwering? I termed Anabaptiſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a monſtrous broode, ſacrilegious theeves, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Diſciples &amp;c. Doe theſe ſavour of nothing but cenſuring? Are theſe the ſenſuall and groundleſſe arguments you mean? But I argued that the promiſes of God made unto the Jewes in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> were ſpirituall and eternall promiſes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.32. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. And this you paſſe by untouched, not becauſe the argument is ſenſuall and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but becauſe you cannot anſwer it. Moreover I told you that circumciſion was the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and that this ſeale was imprinted on very Infants in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. And is this a groundleſſe and ſenſuall argument, not worth the anſwering? Alas, alas, you cannot anſwer it. And therefore for ought you have ſaid, or can ſay, my doctrine muſt ſtand good, and the gates of hell cannot prevaile againſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:125778:25"/>it. View it over againe, and conſider it more punctually. And then haply you will either be<note n="†" place="margin">Hodſon, an Ambaptiſt in the city of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> growne as light to the head ſince he was new baptized, as he was light in the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note>

So you uſe many words, and ſport your ſelves with your owne fancies. But as Chriſt anſwered the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they did erre, becauſe they neither knew the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the power of God. So ſay I to you, that you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Nature of Gods Covenant of free Grace with His people: And who wrongs Chriſt think you? You or I? You in making the grace of God of leſſe extent by the comming of Chriſt, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Moſes</hi> above Chriſt? For <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed Infants of Gods Covenant people the initiall ſeale in their infancy, but Chriſt denies it unto them, if your Divinity will hold.

The beleeving party is ſaid to have a ſanctified uſe of the infidell, but the infidell is not ſaid to be holy, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are. For ſuch children are not ſaid to bee ſactified unto the parents, but holy in themſelves, by reaſon of the holy Covenant under which they were borne, as children of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:125778:26"/>a parent in Covenant with God, and joint-confederates. In the originall the unbeleeving party is ſaid to bee holy not <hi>to,</hi> but <hi>in</hi> the beleeving party. Not that one of them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conſidered were ſanctified in another, for wee are ſanctified only in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the relation of husband and wife in lawfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, ſo the infidell party is ſanctified in the beleeving party for conjugall ſociety, and for raiſing up of an holy ſeed unto God. And if you can but look into the originall, and conſider the ſcope of the place, you cannot but ſuffrage with me. But goe on.</p>

But in this expoſition both you and your maſter ſeem to affirme a ſtrange paradox, namely, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:125778:27"/>children borne of unbeleeving parents are all baſtards, which may overthrow all ſucceſſion in Kingdomes, and inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by this Divinity all the primitive Chriſtians were baſtards, becauſe borne in Paganiſme. And <hi>Abraham</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull was a baſtard too, becauſe his Father was an Idolater. But I pray how doth your reaſon prove your aſſertion? You ſay in effect that children of one beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parent are not baſtards, but legitimates, and that this is meant by the holineſſe the Apoſtle here attributes to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And why? Becauſe (ſay you) that the Apoſtle doth here anſwer an objection as ſome of the beleeving <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> might make concerning their preſent condition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might live with their wives now, they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and their wives infidels. You ſay the Apoſtles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this is, that they might live together, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion doth not diſanull matrimony. Well, this reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes your owne aſſertion, for it implies that infidels may live together in matrimony; how then can the children of ſuch be baſtards? Muſt not then their children lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeend and be borne of their loines? Thus you ſpeak contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And where find you any ſuch language as yours, in the Scriptures? What authours have you conſulted for the meaning of that text. <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Paraus</hi> tells us that ſuch children are not uncleane, but holy <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaies he, not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, but Chriſtians. <hi>Tremelius</hi> ſaith, that the children are ſaid to be holy, becauſe they are partakers of the holineſſe of God in the Church (<hi>ex foedere</hi>) by the Covenant. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaies the children are holy. i. e. <hi>In promiſſione cenſeantur, &amp;c.</hi> they are judged to be in the promiſe, becauſe unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beleever it's ſaid, <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed. Peter Martyr</hi> thus. This holineſſe is beleeved to bee, that theſe children doe appertaine to the Church of Chriſt. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin ut ſancti in in Eccleſia reputentur.</hi> i. e. That they might be reputed Saints in the Church. And you confeſſe that ſuch children are holy in the Apoſtles eſtimation; And if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle eſteemes them holy, then God judgeth them to bee holy,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:125778:28"/>and for holy children of Gods Covenant-people wee muſt take them to bee, according to the conſtant phraſe of the Scripture. For where faith is, there Chriſt is, where Chriſt is, there the holy Covenant is, but faith is with the beleeving parent, therefore Chriſt and the holy Covenant is with him alſo, and the Covenant is, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> Therefore the holineſſe of children (that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of) muſt needs be holines peculiar to the children of faithfull parents. But holineſſe of children by legitimation is not peculiar unto children of beleeving parents. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the civill heathens, and Pagans, have not men their own wives, and women their own husbands? Are not theſe joined together in lawfull matrimony? And are not the children that iſſue from men and women ſo joined, their own children lawfully deſcended, and borne of their loines? And are not ſuch children ſo begotten of perſons in wedlock therefore holy, becauſe lawfully deſcended, and borne of their loines? If to bee meere legitimates bee to bee holy, then the Apoſtle doth predicate no peculiar thing of the children of Chriſtians, more then may be ſaid of the children of Pagans, begotten and borne in wedlock. Then the Apoſtle need not to have ſaid that now they are holy, ſeeing one of you is a beleever, for they were holy before, if legitimation would make them holy. But let <hi>Pareus, Tremelius, Beza, Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> hold their peace, and let us a little heare what your worthy Founder <hi>Th. Lamb</hi> ſaies for the true meaning of the Apoſtle, in this text. <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. Thus ſaith he. <hi>As for the</hi> 7 Cor. 14. <hi>I ſay that the holineſſe of the children did not ariſe from that one parent was a beleever (as our oppoſites ſay) but from this that the unbeleever was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by or to the beleever, which could not have been if they had not been lawfully married before, therefore the holineſſe of the children ſpoken of here, can be no other but that which is oppoſed to baſtardy.</hi> Here this wiſe man maintains the contradictory of your oppoſites concluſion. He ſaies that the holines of the children doth not ariſe from that one parent was a beleever.

From this (ſaies he) that the unbeleever was ſanctified to or by the beleever. Very good! becauſe the unbeleever was ſanctified to the beleever, therefore the children of ſuch were holy. And why was the unbeliever ſanctified to the believer? Was it not becauſe hee was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, and ſo made pure by faith, and then unto the pure all things are pure. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. Now then, becauſe hee was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, therefore the infidell was ſanctified to him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall ſocietie, and becauſe the infidell was ſanctified to the beleever for conjugall ſocietie, therefore the children of ſuch were holy, and ſo by neceſſary conſequence becauſe one of the parents was a beleever, therefore the children were holy. Faith made the conjugall ſocietie holy, the holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall ſociety made the children holy, and therefore faith made the children holy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how can the faith of the parent make the children holy?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely, not by infuſing of ſanctifying grace into the children, but by putting the parent into Chriſt.

But you acknowledge that the parents of the holy children here ſpoken off were lawfully married before (you meane) while in the ſtate of infidels. And therefore it muſt be the holineſſe of the Covenant of grace, which the faith
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:125778:29"/>of the parent put himſelfe, and his children under. But you ſay in the laſt paragraph of your letter to your Diſciples, <hi>that Infants were in the Covenant legally, but not Evangelically; and that when the law ceaſed, this being in Covenant ceaſed with it.</hi> But for ſo ſaying, you deſerve a pillory, not a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:125778:30"/>to be given upon the ground of imputative righteouſneſſe, for the righteouſneſſe of faith is imputative righteouſneſſe: but I find it to be adminiſtred upon this ground, and therefore upon the ground of imputative righteouſneſſe. And circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion unto the Infants of the Jewes, was a ſeale of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but not of righteouſneſſe in their perſonall practice and confeſſion, and therefore of imputative righteouſneſſe.

And now you bring inſtances of ſuch, whoſe parents were not in the ſtate of Chriſtianity, which is a quite contrary caſe. But prove by Scripture that the children of the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>baptized were denied Baptiſme, untill they could give account of their faith, or elſe you ſpeak not to the point, ſeeing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren borne of Chriſtian parents are Chriſtians by birth, but ſuch as you inſtance in were not. And is this faire dealing think you? And what talke you of an imputed holineſſe in a child, that it ſhould draw from it parents? What imputed holineſſe is it you meane? Imputative righteouſneſſe? Doe you think that imputative righteouſneſſe is in us? How differs it then from inherent righteouſneſſe? The words imply a contradiction. And had you ever been rightly grounded in the principles of our Religion, you would never have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo abſurd a paſſage. For the children doe not draw holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from their parents in Covenant, but as companions in Covenant with their parents are primitively holy, as well as their parents, by vertue of the ſame Covenant. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of the Covenant are, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> Here the Covenant puts parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren both in equall relation unto God. But here you renew your old quarrell againſt the Covenant of grace, like an old trotting horſe, let never ſo skilfull a rider uſe his beſt art to bring him into a better pace, yet the carrion will fall into his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:125778:30"/>old joulting trot againe, ſo you tell us againe that circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not adminiſtred unto <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, by vertue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holineſſe imputed unto Infants by the Covenant, but by vertue of Gods command. This is your meaning, however your expreſſions be. And we anſwer againe, that becauſe they were an holy ſeed, that therefore the Lord commanded them to be circumciſed. For the Covenant in order of nature muſt goe before the confirmation and ſeale thereof. So that the ground of Gods commanding <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, was their being in the holy, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſeed ſet apart unto God from other nations. And therefore the Lord doth not barely command <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe his males, but He brings it in with a THEREFORE, to ſhew that the Covenant having made them an holy ſeed, therefore they wereto have the initiall ſeale imprinted on thoſe holy perſons. For marke the words (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 12.) of the Covenant. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between Me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations for an everlaſting Covenant to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee. And will give unto thee and thy ſeed after thee the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſsion, and I will be their God, verſe</hi> 7, 8. And hereupon God ſaid unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> thou ſhalt circumciſe thy males therefore. Not barely thou ſhalt circumciſe thy males, but thou ſhalt circumciſe thy males therefore. <hi>i. e.</hi> Becauſe of the foregoeing Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the 7. and 8. verſes. This inference we have verſe 9. in theſe words, <hi>viz. Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou and thy ſeed after thee in their generations.</hi> And then whereas they might have asked the Lord what that Covenant was which He would have them to keep. The Lord anſwers in the to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſe. after this manner; <hi>viz. This is My Covenant which yee ſhall keep between Me and you, and thy ſeed after thee, every man-child ſhall bee circumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> Here circumciſion is called by the name of the Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Covenant is the ground of it.

And ſo this lame ſhift will not ſerve your turne. And to conclude, as little to the purpoſe is it, which you ſay concerning Baptiſme; for you ſay, that Baptiſme is not to be given by vertue of holineſſe imputed to the child, but by vertue of Chriſts Commiſſion, as if holineſſe imputed unto a child by vertue of an holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant were not Chriſts Commiſſion. The nations which Chriſt ſent His Apoſtles unto, were not ſaid to bee holy, and therefore by teaching they muſt make them holy, before they baptize them. But the children of thoſe holy ones were holy by birth, and ſo called by God himſelf, and therefore to be put under the initiall ſeale of Gods holy Covenant, as their right and priviledge by nature and birth.</p>

                        <hi>Againe, you parallell this place with</hi> Rom. 11.16. <hi>where you ſay, that is the root be holy, ſo are the branches.

But if you take it in a more ſpirituall ſenſe, then it may be meant of Chriſt being the root, and all beleevers are His members.

(to prove that the children of parents in Covenant are holy by vertue of Gods holy Covenant) I ſhall not draw my lines awry. Seeing the expreſſe words of the Covenant are, <hi>I will bee thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> And both places prove, that both pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children are holy by vertue of Gods holy Covenant with them. And ſo both places are coincident to prove the ſame thing, though there may be ſome circumſtantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. The place then in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. makes much for my purpoſe. For my purpoſe was to prove that as the children of the Jewes were holy, by vertue of the holy Covenant with their parents, ſo alſo are the children of the Gentiles holy, by vertue of the ſame holy Covenant with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; (an argument never too often to be inculcated.) And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:125778:32"/>now having ſpoken of that text of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. already in our former diſcourſe, we will ſay ſome what for the ſenſe and meaning of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. which text muſt needs bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and meant of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his branches only. Now the queſtion is, who are meant by <hi>Abrahams</hi> branches. Well, the point there to prove is, that as <hi>Abrahams</hi> children among the Jewes were partakers of the priuiledges of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo among the Gentiles, children engrafted into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> are partakers of the Covenant as well as the naturall branches of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Jewes. And hence I inferred, that as the Jewes receiving the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo Gentiles receiving the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> are to be baptized. And as the Jewes that were not internally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently godly (as long as they did not renounce <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith) had a right to circumciſion, ſo the children of the Gentiles receiving the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> were by Baptiſme (as Jewes by circumciſion) to bee admitted into the enjoyment of the priviledges of the Chriſtian Church. <hi>Peter</hi> tels the Jewes that <hi>the promiſe is unto them and their children. Acts</hi> 2.39. Now the promiſe was not made to their ſeed, becauſe they did beleeve, but the ſeed did beleeve becauſe they were under the promiſe. <hi>viz. I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> If this muſt be reſtrained thus; <hi>viz.</hi> I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed too, when thy ſeed ſhall beleeve, then no more is promiſed to this ſeed, then to the ſeed of the Gentiles for when the ſeed of any Gentile ſhould make proſeſſion of his faith in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> he was to be circumciſed, as well as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But more was due by this promiſe to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then to the ſeed of a Gentile: therefore the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was under the promiſe in a peculiar manner, and not the ſeed of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile uncircumciſed: yea among the Jewes a parent who was orthodoxall in judgement, albeit he ſhewed no proofe of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith in his life, yet he was put under the Covenant for him and his ſeed. And the children of ſuch had as much right to circumciſion, as the children of <hi>David.</hi> So then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:125778:32"/>ſubjection to the doctrine of faith doth entitle the parent, and his ſeed to the right of the externall benefit of the Covenant. The ſumme is, that as Jewes were born Jewes, ſo the ſeale of circumciſion was their due, not to put them under the Covenant, but to ſeale up the Covenant under which they were borne. So (ſay I) Chriſtians children are borne Chriſtians, and a right to the Covenant is not given them by Baptiſme, but that right which they had by birth is put under ſeale. The very Covenant under which a Chriſtian Infant is born, ſtands good unto him, and bindes him to faith &amp; obedience, and ſo albeit Anabaptiſts (like ſo many enraged devills, doe what in them lies to cancell the hand-writing of Almighty God by withholding Gods owne ſeale from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Chriſtian parents, upon whom Hee hath engraven His Covenant, and written His promiſes of grace and mercy, by virtue of their being born of ſuch parents. A wickedneſſe ſo heinous, ſo horrible, ſo full of impiety and helliſh cruelty, that I want a parallel, I want words to expreſſe it unto my reader) yet Gods Covenant (I ſay) ſtands good, unto them. Now the Lord make you to underſtand what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and give you a ſight of your wickedneſſe. And thus you have my firſt reaſon vindicated.

But to your meaning, I anſwer that for the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of circumciſion; <hi>Abraham</hi> by the inſtitution was not to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:125778:34"/>bee circumciſed till hee gave teſtimony of his faith in the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> but then his ſeed was to be circumciſed in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, before they could give any other proofe of their faith, then their being borne of parents in Covenant. And their being borne of parents in Covenant gave them right to the initiall ſeale, as wee have ſhewed before. So the Gentiles were not to be baptized (as <hi>Abraham</hi> not to be circumciſed) till they did ſhew forth proofes of their faith. But when the parent ba entred himſelfe, his children were to be baptized (as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed were to be circumciſed) before they could ſhew any more proofe of faith, then their being borne of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in Covenant. Chriſt indeed (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.) gave charge, that whom His Apoſtles had taught, they ſhould bee baptized; but that none ſhould bee baptized but ſuch as were firſt taught, that's your additionall, and of that you neither doe, nor can make proofe. You were anſwered ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, that in raiſing a Church among Pagans, faith muſt be the doore of admittance. This was the Apoſtles caſe. But when beleeving Pagans were baptized, I deſire proofe that their ſeed muſt bring a verdict of their beleeving, ere they could be baptized. Divines tell us, that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of Baptiſmes, and impoſition of hands: By impoſition of hands the Apoſtle meanes a practice then in uſe, that ſuch children as were baptized ſhould after make profeſſion of their faith, and ſo be admitted by impoſition of hands to the Lords Supper. Now you will have profeſſion of faith goe before, and afford ſuch as are borne Chriſtians no more priviledge, then meere Pagans borne out of the Church. You ſay that by Chriſts charge and Commiſſion <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. we are bound as ſtrictly to obſerve Chriſts rule for Baptiſme, as the Jewes to obſerve the order of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Right. And therefore as <hi>Abraham</hi> was not, and no Proſelyte was to be circumciſed till he gave teſtimony of his faith, ſo no Alien, no Pagan, is to bee baptized till hee ſhew forth his faith. But as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the ſeed of any circumciſed Proſelyte were to be circumciſed while In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,

A perpetuall mark in the fleſh which the circumciſed (though circumciſed in infancy) could after make uſe of. But when? When they came to years of diſcretion?

This argues that the efficacy of Gods ordinances of grace depends upon the act of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In this you may ſhake hands with <hi>Rome,</hi> and exclude grace, and ſet up works. Here is much ſpoken of the act of man, but not a word of the Act of God in His ordinances of grace.

                  <p>Such as diſcerne not the ſacramentall ſigne in the preſent act of adminiſtration, have the ſacramentall ſigne given in vaine.</p>
                  <p>But Infants of Chriſtians doe not diſcerne the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſigne in Baptiſme in the preſent action of adminiſtration; Ergo.</p>
                  <p>Infants of Chriſtians have the ſacramentall ſigne of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme given in vaine.</p>
                  <p>This argument proves, that the ſacramentall ſigne of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was given to the Jewiſh Infants in vaine alſo, for they could not diſcerne that ſigne as a Sacrament, for though they had bodily feeling of the cutting off of their fleſh, yet they could not in the preſent act of adminiſtration diſcerne
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:125778:35"/>the ſigne, as ſacramentall, and ſo our Infants have bodily feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the water too. And ſo your quarrell is againſt God, as well as againſt us. But as ſuch as were borne Jewes were to have the initiall ſeale of the preſent miniſtration imprinted on them in their infancy to ſeale up the Covenant (under which they were borne) unto them, though they could have no ſuch diſcerning as you ſeem to require in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent act of adminiſtration; ſo ſuch as are borne Chriſtians are to have the intiall ſeale of the preſent miniſtration imprinted on them in their infancy, to ſeale up the Covenant (under which they are borne) unto them, though they can have no ſuch diſcerning as you require, and yet the ordinance effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unto them too. I thought that Baptiſme had been a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall act of Gods mercy and grace, and that the ſaving effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and benefits thereof had not depended upon the Act of the receiver, but upon the operative mercy of God, and Merits of Chriſt. But it ſeems your Divinity ſhewes me a new way. But why muſt Infants of Chriſtians diſcerne the ſigne of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Baptiſme, in the preſent act? What? Becauſe water leaves no impreſſion upon the body, but ſhortly after the act is over, the body is as dry as if it had not been waſhed at all? And when the child is come to yeares hee findes no viſible mark upon his body, to aſſure him that he is ſealed into Gods peculiar? Oh! Is this it? I pray what mark is there left upon your fleſh, ſince you were waſhed in <hi>Severne,</hi> though you were duckt over head and eares? Is a mark in the fleſh, and a ſenſitive diſcerning of the ſigne, the excellencies of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Baptiſme? When the Iewes came to yeares of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning. God called not for the circumciſion of their fleſh, but for the circumciſion of their hearts. It was the mark of circumciſion upon the heart that God looked upon, for many had the mark of the fleſh, which were as bad as <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</hi> So for us Chriſtians when wee are come to yeares of diſcretion, its the mark of the Spirit, and of the blood of Chriſt upon the heart, that God calls for, and looks upon. For a man may have the ſigne of water, and diſcerne the ſigne
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:125778:36"/>in the very act with the eye of his fleſh, and yet be a vile A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt, deny originall ſinne in Infants, deny the Chriſtian Sabbath, and ſet up the Iewiſh, deny Chriſts taking fleſh of the Virgin MARY, deny the power of the Magiſtrate, and a 1000 ſuch like abominations; and a man be baptized in his infancy, and want your diſcerning; and yet when hee is come to yeares of diſcretion, he may be an holy and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſtian, ſound in judgement, regular in all his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſincere in all his aimes.

Now men are brought into Gods Covenant either by inſtruction, or borne under this holy Covenant as the ſeed of perſons in Covenant with God. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Proſelytes became the ſubjects of Circumciſion by profeſſion of their faith in the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But the ſeed of circumciſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the circumciſed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:125778:36"/>Proſelytes were ſuch by birth, as children of parents in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. So when the Apoſtles in primitive times planted foundations of the Chriſtian faith among the Pagans. Theſe Pagans were made ſubjects capable of Baptiſme by inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the ſeed of theſe baptized Pagans were capable of Baptiſme by birth, as joint heires with their parents of the ſame holy Covenant, and that Covenant (under which they were borne) was to bee put under ſeale unto them. So then as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and the Proſelites ſeed, were to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, when and while Infants, for Chriſtians children are to be baptized when and while Infants; ſuch Infants being not Infidels, <hi>ergo</hi> beleevers, as afterward you ſhall ſee in due place. And ſo the baptizing of Chriſtian Infants is no inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, but grounded on the Covenant of God with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and their children. And this the book of God warrants every where. And whereas you ſay, that the promiſe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and all his lineall ſeed was of a temporall inheritance, and that circumciſion was a ſigne of that: That is falſe, if you meane only or chiefly of a temporall inheritance (the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inheritance was theirs, not as temporall neither, but as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall) for 1. Circumciſion was a ſigne and ſeale of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of faith in the <hi>Meſsias.</hi> 2. The Proſelytes with their children were circumciſed, to whom right unto that temporall inheritance of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. 3. Neither did it belong unto all <hi>Abrahams</hi> lineall ſeed, as before we have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>And ſo all this is, as it is unſound, ſo fallacious and abſurd.</p>

Now if Male Infants had the ſeale of ſuch an inheritance and Covenant upon ſuch ſpirituall grounds in Such a Saviour, binding the circumciſed Infant to divine faith &amp; univerſall obedience (though he could diſcern none of theſe matters) then Male-Infants of Chriſtians (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne under the ſame holy Covenant of grace) are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:125778:37"/>capable of the initiall ſeale thereof, as children of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in Covenant with God, and of the holy ſeed by birth. So then (to exclude females) grant males to bee capable of Baptiſme upon the ground of circumciſion, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt your owne principle. But all <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males as well as the males) ſtood in Gods acceptation for circumciſed, as appears in the ſtory of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who ſeeing a woman of the daughters of the Philiſtines in <hi>Timnath,</hi> fell in love with her, and ſpake to his Father and Mother to get her for him to wife. Then his Father, and his Mother ſaid unto him. Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goeſt to take a wife of the uncircumciſed Philiſtines. <hi>Judges</hi> 14.1, 2, 3.

                     <label>Anſwer.</label> My third Argument for Paedo-baptiſme from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. runs thus. The Commandement of baptizing is univerſall to the whole Church, but Infants of Chriſtian parents are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and therefore the command of baptizing is to be extended unto them, as before we have amply decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now if Infants of ſuch parents be not members of the Church, then ſo dying they cannot be ſaved; ſithence none can be ſaved, but by Chriſt, and Chriſt came to ſave his Church onely: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. Wherein now (I pray) am I ſo fouly miſtaken, and wherein doe I wreſt the Text? Chriſt ſaith indeed, that ſuch as are taught muſt be baptized, but Chriſt ſaith not, that none muſt be baptized but ſuch as are taught. Prove that, or let this Text alone. The Text ſaith, baptize all in the Church, therefore Infants of baptized pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, unleſſe you can ſhew a place that exempts them. Chriſt doth not ſay, goe teach all Nations, and ſo baptize all the Nation: Neither did I, nor will, unleſſe the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall embrace the doctrine of Chriſt.

For the buſineſſe of the Apoſtles lay in planting of foundations, and in erecting of Churches, conſiſting of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of yeares. And the Apoſtles baptized but a poore few of the multitudes that were converted by their miniſtry. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13, 17. Now if theſe words <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. muſt be urged in the ſtrict letter, then it had beene a ſinne for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, not to baptize ſuch as by his preaching he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but this is no ſinne, for then he would not have thanked God, that he baptized none of the Corinthians, but <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. And yet <hi>Paul</hi> did beget the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians in Jeſus Chriſt by his preaching. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. Or he made them Diſciples, but baptized very few of them; and therefore the text cannot be urged in the ſtrict letter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to diſpute negatively from the Scripture in a matter of fact, (<hi>viz.</hi> we doe not reade that the Apoſtles, or any elſe baptized any Infants, therefore there were none baptized by any of them) is a kinde of arguing fit for fooles, not for ſchooles; and yet this is the onely Divinity of your Church. Upon this ground I argue upon more probable reaſon: We doe not reade in the ſtory of the Church, from the Baptiſt to the end of the Acts, that the Apoſtles, or any others, did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize a childe of any Chriſtian, when he was growne up to yeares, but the baptized Chriſtians being millions, had many children in that great tract of time, and baptized they were.

I told you that Chriſts Commiſſion in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. was a full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to all Chriſts Miniſters under the Goſpell, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and ordinary; and that this Commiſſion was, that the Word ſhould be preached, and that the Sacraments ſhould be adminiſtred; and that ordinary Paſtours and Teachers in ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>led Congregations did execute this Commiſſion fully, though they went not from Nation to Nation, and from place to place. Now if ſuch a circumſtance may be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall, without violation of the Commiſſion, then the Commiſſion of Chriſt there given, bindes not all Miniſters in every circumſtance: For wee told you, that this being a full Commiſſion to all the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, to direct them in the worke of the Miniſtry: and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus Chriſt being partly extraordinary, and partly ordinary, therefore in this Commiſſion here muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar unto the Apoſtles (being extraordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) which did not, nay, could not be found in ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Teachers. Now ordinary Paſtours muſt preach and baptize, as well as the Apoſtles. What then is peculiar to Apoſtles (as being extraordinary Miniſters) in this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I anſwer, that it's peculiar to Apoſtles here (being pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Holy Ghoſt, inſpired immediately by the Holy Ghoſt) to plant foundations, to deliver binding rules of faith and worſhip immediately from God unto the Churches, which before were not given unto the ſonnes of men: By their preaching and working of miracles they were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Jewes and Gentiles, that Chriſt (the ſonne of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> which the Jewes did crucifie) was the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias and Saviour of mankinde, the onely begotten ſonne of God; And ſuch as did embrace the doctrine and faith of Chriſt, they muſt baptize: And many were called unto the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:125778:43"/>obedience of the faith, by the doctrine and miracles of the Apoſtles, and theſe did fulfill their miniſtery, when they had planted theſe foundations, and delivered the full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Goſpell unto the Churches, and ſo being thus planted, they did deliver over the Churches unto ordinary paſtours and teachers, as holy companies in Covenant with God, whereas before they were Idolaters, and Pagans, and murtherers. Now I hope you expect not new canons of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, you doe not expect that ordinary Miniſters ſhould work miracles The practiſe of the Apoſtles is not then to be followed in things of extraordinary priviledge, but in matters of ordinary faith and mortality. Now ordinary pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours finde parents in the ſtate of Chriſtianity, in Covenant with God, and under His ſeale, and therefore they doe and muſt baptize their children in their infancy. The ſtrict urging of Apoſtolicall imitation is wicked and plaine confuſion; ſomething is here peculiar to extraordinary Miniſters.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:125778:43"/>in this generall Commiſſion, and of what is common to Apoſtles and ordinary paſtours, and you are anſwered. I ſay, in this ſhort ſumme of words, we have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall miniſtery and the paſtorall miniſtery included. The Apoſtolicall miniſtery being extraordinary and to bee but for a time is ceaſed, and no ordinary Miniſters are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſuch a miniſtery as the Apoſtles did, by vertue of their peculiar function, neither doe we, nor can wee expect any ſuch Miniſters, becauſe we ought not to expect any new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of holy Scripture, nor an alteration of the preſent Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. The canon of the ſacred Scripture is full, and the preſent Liturgy is to continue unto the worlds end.

And you run it over againe and againe, and ſtill you have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Commiſſion and practice up; whereas if you look upon their Commiſſion and practice as extraordinary and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, both are peculiar unto them, and to ceaſe with them. And (as I ſaid before) Apoſtles are not to be followed by us in things of extraordinary priviledge, but in matters of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary faith and morality. And ſo however your peeviſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings may lead your ſelves into a fooles paradiſe, yet they ſhall never drive us from the wayes of Chriſt.</p>

Nay there are creatures worſe then the worſt of them, and therefore you are a falſe accuſer and unjuſt ſlanderer, and you cannot make it good. But you have forgotten the buſineſſe in hand again, I told you that God did ordinarily make our baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants effectuall to the ends, whereunto true Baptiſme is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Goſpell. And this the Lord may doe, though the moſt of thoſe that we baptize in their infancy prove vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in their converſation, and but few of them religious; as long as the Lord doth it ordinarily, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ordinary meanes and uſually, as by His word and ordinances in His Church, for what elſe can you underſtand by the word [ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily?] I ſay, as long as the Lord doth thus ordinarily make our baptizing of Infants effectuall to the proper ends of true Baptiſme, appointed in the Goſpell, though but to a few of the baptized, our argument ſtands good. And you can no more conclude from the vitiouſneſſe of the baptized in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, that that practice of baptizing Infants is abominable, then you may from the vitiouſneſſe of the Jewes, that their circumciſion in their infancy was abominable, becauſe there were but few of them, unto whom God ordinarily made it effectuall to the proper ends, whereunto it was appointed in the word, for among them there were but few that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive in the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> &amp; yield obedience unto Gods holy Law in heart and life. And now how juſt your concluſion is from my premiſes, let all men ſee. And no wonder that you make my premiſes ſpeak what you pleaſe. And ſhould we judge of your Baptiſme by your fruits, <hi>i. e.</hi> by your doctrine and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, (for that is the true meaning of <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16. as you may ſee clearely evinced by the verſe immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.) I ſay, ſhould a man judge of the Baptiſme of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts by their doctrine and tenents, he could not but conclude,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:125778:46"/>that your Baptiſme is a moſt abominable and execrable thing (though you are <hi>adulti</hi> before you are <hi>adulti</hi> before you are baptized.) For Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts deny originall ſinne in Infants, and hold a bundle of hereſies, as you may ſee in <hi>Oſianders</hi> Enchiridion of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies with Anabaptiſts. And the moſt ſtrict in your religion are the moſt vile, and God doth not ordinarily make your Baptiſme effectuall to the proper ends, whereunto true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is appointed in the Goſpell. And whereas you ſay that we may ſee, that it is the word that makes children and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fit for Baptiſme, and not their parentage, I think herein you ſay you know not what, in making an oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the word and parentage, if by parentage, you meane Chriſtian parentage, if not, you ſpeak not to the point in hand. We ſay that the word fits all for Baptiſme. The word of inſtruction in the Covenant makes the alien fit for Baptiſme, and the word of the Covenant makes children of baptized parents fit for Baptiſme, as the word of inſtruction made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Proſelytes fit for circumciſion, but the word of the Covenant made their children fit for circumciſion in their infancy. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9.</p>

Our agreement is ſuch, that we are all one in the point of Paedo-baptiſme againſt you. We (in this Land) hold, that children of all baptized parents are baptizable in their infancie, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace, under which ſuch children were borne, as children of all circumciſed parents were circumciſable in their infancie, by vertue of the ſame Covenant of Grace, under which they were borne; and this is the opinion and practice of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches that I know, as the <hi>French, Scottiſh, Dutch,</hi> High and Low, &amp;c.

Except beleevers enter into their Covenant, they ſhall have no commons with them at the Lords table, neither ſhall their children be baptized by them. But their warrant for this practice we deſire to ſee, for we think it unjuſt and impious, that perſons under Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, ſhould be deprived of gods ſeales, which he hath inſeparably annexed unto that Covenant. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, for them to deny baptiſme unto children of baptized parents, I ſee no reaſon, though ſuch parents are vitious in their lives, as long as ſuch parents remaine within the Church, and are orthodox all in the faith. I am ſure that the children of the Jewes (whoſe parents were profane in life) were not kept backe from the Sacrament of circumciſion, for that cauſe; And the reaſon is, becauſe that Covenant was the Covenant of Grace, and not of Workes. There are two Covenants that God hath made with men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Workes, and the Covenant of Grace. And of theſe Covenants there were two heads, namely, the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> With the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> God did ſtrike a Covenant of Workes; and <hi>Adam</hi> the head of this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:125778:50"/>body in Covenant did tranſgreſſe, and ſo deſtroyed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and thereby deprived himſelfe, and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the priviledges thereof, and ſo death entred upon all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n, in that all had ſinned in their <hi>Head.</hi> With the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> viz. Chriſt, God did ſtrike a Covenant of Grace; and Chriſt the head of his body in this Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines juſt, and the juſtifier of his members; and therefore his members cannot be deprived of the priviledges of this Covenant, for the default of immediate parents. Now for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe men in this way (as they ſay) of <hi>New-England,</hi> to put a ſtop unto the Covenant of Grace; in denying baptiſme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to children of baptized parents, I ſee no warrant. For firſt, This practice deſtroyes the nature of this Covenant. For the parents by their miſcarriage have broken the Covenant of Workes, but not the Covenant of Grace; this remaines en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in Chriſt, who is the head of the children borne under this Covenant. And theſe children, though by naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration they are the off-ſpring of ſuch wicked parents, yet by reaſon of the Covenant under which they were borne, they are the children of the Covenant. This practice then is a preſumption of an higher nature than theſe men are aware off: And albeit their intent be a reformation, yet the meanes is diabolicall. Secondly, This practice doth vertually accuſe Chriſt the Head, as a violater of this Covenant of Grace; for as long as the Head remaines juſt, and the juſtifier of his members, his members are not to be debarred of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges whereof under the Goſpell Baptiſme is the firſt. And the vitious carriage of immediate parents, can no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a childe from Baptiſme now, than could formerly the vitious carriage of Jewiſh parents, exclude their children from the priviledge of Circumciſion. Now ſome (to evade this) ſay, that the Church of the Jewes was a Nationall Chruch, but the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not ſo. But this is but a meere ſhift to evade what they cannot anſwer, for Proſelytes who were not of that Nation, were to have their children circumciſed, and circumciſion was enjoyned and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:125778:51"/>practiſed before the Jewes were a Nationall Church, even when and while they were a Family-Church. But to the point, I ſay that the Church of the Jewes was a Nationall Church in ſome things after a peculiar manner; as Firſt, God had tyed himſelfe to remaine with that Nation by his Ordinances of grace, untill <hi>Shiloh</hi> came. Secondly, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was once a yeare (in the repreſentative body thereof) to meet at one common place, (<hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>) about the worſhip of God by divine appointment. Now God hath not tyed himſelfe to the Church of <hi>England</hi> for any ſet terme of time; nor is there by divine appointment any ſet place of worſhip for the whole Nation to meet in once a yeare, about the worſhip of God. But thirdly, the Church of the Jewes was a Nationall Church, becauſe the whole Nation had received the Doctrine and Covenant of grace, and in this ſenſe I hope <hi>England</hi> is a Nationall Church. And if in this ſenſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> be a Nationall Church, that's as much as I require. But ſurely theſe men have ſome other meaning (when they ſay that the Church of the Jewes was a Nationall Church, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not) than as yet they dare to utter, (though among them you ſhall ſeldome finde a man tongue-tyed.) Their meaning is, that the whole Nation of the Jewes pell-mell, were by courſe to be admitted to the priviledges of that typicall miniſtration, and ſo the children of vitious parents too, becauſe of that Nation; but under the Goſpell ſince Chriſt, onely the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of godly parents are to be ſealed into Gods peculiar by baptiſme, and others are not; and here they would bring in their Covenant as the forme of the Church: But the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Jewes were not circumciſed becauſe of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but becauſe of gods Covenant with that Nation. And ſo our children are not to be baptized becauſe of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but becauſe of Gods Covenant with ſuch a Nation; and the children of all baptized parents are borne under Gods Covenant of grace, and whether their parents be vitious or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:125778:51"/>religious in life, the childes title ſtands good to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The religious lives of his parents <hi>(being workes)</hi> doe not entitle him to the Covenant and initiall ſeale thereof. And the vitious life of parents baptized <hi>(being workes)</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make voyde the childes title to the Covenant and initiall ſeale thereof. For his title unto the Covenant and initiall ſeale thereof lies in Chriſt, who remaines juſt, and the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of his members; and the elect ſeed may paſſe through the loynes of vitious parents, and often doe, whereas godly parents may have reprobates to their children. If then theſe men have any thing to object againſt Chriſt, as a violater of the Covenant of Grace, let them ſay on, and they ſhall bee anſwered; but if nothing, how dare they deny the initiall ſeale of this Covenant unto the children of this Covenant. Now many honeſt-hearted Chriſtians carried away with the faire ſhew of theſe men, doe not ſee the high iniquity of this practice. 3. The practice of debarring infants of baptized parents from baptiſme, for the looſe lives of their parents is no better than high ſacriledge: For ſuch children being not Pagans, borne out of the Church, but Chriſtians, borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, and of the holy ſeed; borne (I ſay) under the Covenant of Grace, are therefore to have (as their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right) that Covenant under which they were borne, put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeale unto them For the miſcarriage of the parents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deprive the children of their portion in Gods Covenant of Grace; ſeeing workes are not the ground of that right of theirs, but Gods free grace in Chriſt: and the childe hath as primitive a right unto this Covenant as the parent. For the words of the Covenant are, <hi>I will be they God, and the God of thy ſeed after thee in their generations.</hi> And therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vitious parents are to bee kept backe from the Lords Supper for their reformation, yet their infants cannot be kept backe from Baptiſme, and ſo put a ſtop unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, where God puts none. Fourthly and laſtly, as this is a new way, ſo it's grounded upon new-Divinity, which none of the orthodox Divines in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:125778:52"/>were ever principled in, in the Schooles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for if that the perſonall ſinne of the immediate parent be a barre againſt inſants baptiſme, then there are more ſins imputed beſides the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> but there is no other ſinne imputed, but onely the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> And thus you ſee that I am as great an adverſary againſt thoſe whoſe practiſes doe any way oppugne the nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, as I am againſt you. For my purpoſe is to maintaine the quarrell of Gods Covenant againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, as 'tis my duty and office, and I hope my Brethren and Fathers in the Univerſities and in the Countrey, will aſſoord me their pious ayde and aſſiſtance. And that all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will beſeech God at the Throne of Grace, to carry on His owne worke in me, and in all that ſhall endeavour to hold forth the Truth of God unto His people, that godly hearts and tender conſciences may not bee miſ-led by the good words and faire ſpeeches of Satans agents. And for you that are carried away into this way of re-baptizing, the Lord give you to ſee where you are. And for thoſe of the <hi>Separation,</hi> the Lord ſhew them wherein they doe exceed, for their wayes are not right before the Lord, nor juſtifiable by His Word. And now for you to ſay that you will turne neither to us, nor to thoſe of <hi>New-England,</hi> unleſſe you ſee better grounds; We muſt tell you, that you muſt bring bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exceptions againſt the grounds that wee have laid for Paedo-baptiſme, or elſe we muſt conclude that you blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Name of God, in deſiring his helpe for to ſtrengthen you in your way.</p>

Your meaning is, that Baptiſme is the forme of a Church, and ſo no Baptiſme, no Church, and Baptiſme of Infants is no Baptiſme; as though you were members of no Church, till you were baptized. If of no Church, then no members of Chriſt, and ſo dying not to be ſaved, but haply I miſtake your meaning. You confeſſe that you can bring no example of any gathered Church in the new Teſtament that did deny Baptiſme unto Infants, whoſe parents were baptized, and in the ſtate of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither doth the Holy Ghoſt any where in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament either expreſſely, or by neceſſary deduction deny Baptiſme unto ſuch children. And therefore Anabaptiſts in denying Baptiſme unto children of baptized parents are not therein led by the Spirit of God. The Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes expreſſely, that children even of one beleeving parent are Saints. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and no ſuch thing was predicated of any Gentiles children, before faith in Chriſt put that honour upon them, and yet many, yea moſt of them borne in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock. And <hi>Lamb</hi> your Maſter doth acknowledge the married ſpoken off, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. to bee married, nay lawfully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before faith came to make either their marriage or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren holy. Look upon his letter, and you ſhall find, that either
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:125778:53"/>he ſpeakes that, or plaine non-ſenſe. But I have had ſpeech with your Maſter already about his judgement upon this text, and I think that (if your Maſter will be but ingenous) we are agreed. But you his Diſciple have gotten another trick to put the Holy Ghoſt to ſilence here, in this text. (As the proverbe is, ſeldome comes a better, a bad Maſter, and a worſe Scholler.) You talke of Childrens being holy in the Apoſtles eſtimation. Happily you have gotten that old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pith ſhift, that the Papiſts are wont to have againſt <hi>Pauls</hi> writings. They ſay that all <hi>Pauls</hi> writing is not to be taken for the holy Canon, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, not the Lord but I, not I but the Lord. And in that you ſaid that children were holy in the Apoſtles eſtimation, I ſuppoſe you reſted upon that rotten prop of Popery. And ſo you will have the Holy Ghoſt to have no tongue where you will have no eare; for the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes as well by neceſſary deductions, as in expreſſe words, and the Holy Ghoſt hath a tongue in the true ſenſe of the Scripture, as well as in the expreſſe letter. But you have ſaid enough, you confeſſe you have no example in the new Teſtament, where Baptiſme was ever denied unto Infants of baptized parents, neither have you any Command or Commiſſion from Chriſt our only Monarch, and Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for denying of Baptiſme, unto Infants of baptized pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.

                  <p n="1">1. The Old Covenant had the Law written in tables of ſtone, but the New hath the Law written in the hearts of the worſhippers: <hi>i.e. Moſes</hi> did miniſter the Law unto the Jewes written in tables of ſtone, thus did the type; but Chriſt the anti-type doth miniſter Gods Lawes unto Chriſtians, written in the fleſhly tables of the heart. <hi>Moſes</hi> could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the letter of Gods Law unto the people, but <hi>Moſes</hi> could not change the heart, and renew the minde of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but Chriſt by his Miniſters can change the heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the minde of his worſhippers. And its Chriſts peculiar
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:125778:57"/>prerogative both under the Law, and under the Goſpell, that whatſoever perſons formerly under the Law, have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by grace; and what perſons ſoever have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, or ſhall be renewed under the Goſpell; have, are, and ſhall be renewed by Chriſt, and in Chriſt. This Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was written by the Apoſtle unto the Jewes, and the end of the Apoſtle in writing this Epiſtle, was to take off the Jewes from reſting on the workes of the Law, and Liturgie or Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſalvation and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and to divert their mindes unto Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of life, and to the miniſtration of Chriſts bloud and ſpirit under the Goſpell, or New Teſtament, or Covenant. And that the difference betweene the old Covenant under <hi>Moſes</hi> the type, and the new Covenant under Chriſt the truth and anti-type, lyes not in the thing miniſtred for mans eternall ſalvation, but in the miniſtration of Chriſt to come, and already come, is cleare by that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2, 18. <hi>Ye are our epiſtle written in our hearts, knowne, and read of all men. Foraſmuch as ye are manifeſtly declared to be the epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, written not with inke, but with the spirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart. And ſuch truſt have we through Chriſt to God-ward: Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to thinke any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of God. Who alſo hath made us able Miniſters, not of the letter, but of the spirit: (for the letter killeth, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giveth life.) But if the miniſtration of death written, and engraven in ſtones, was glorious, ſo that the children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly behold the face of</hi> Moſes, <hi>for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away: How ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit be rather glorious? For if the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of righteouſneſſe exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, much more that which remaineth is glorious. Seeing then
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:125778:58"/>we have ſuch hope, we uſe great plainneſſe of speech. And not as</hi> Moſes, <hi>which put a vayle over his face, that the children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly looke to the end of that which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. But their mindes are blinded: for untill this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the ſame vayle untaken away, in the reading of the Old Teſtament: which vayle is done away in Chriſt. But even unto this day, when</hi> Moſes <hi>is read, the vayle is upon their heart. Nevertheleſſe when it (i.e. their heart) ſhall turne to the Lord, the vayle ſhall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> And then, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. he comes with this inference, <hi>viz Therefore ſeeing we have this Miniſtry, &amp;c.</hi> So then the difference lyes in the miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not in the ſubſtance of the Covenant. Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace with man is nothing, but Chriſt for ſalvation, Chriſt in type, and Chriſt in perſon: Chriſt in type before His Incarnation, and Chriſt in perſon ſince. Here Chriſt is ſaid to be the <hi>Mediatour of a better Covenant.</hi> And in the former chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. He is ſaid to be made a <hi>Surety of a better Teſtament.</hi> This better Covenant comming in place did diſanull the former. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18. Now what did it diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null? Surely nothing but the Typicall and Moſaicall Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, or Miniſtration. And what did diſanull this typicall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration? Surely nothing but the body of Chriſt offered up unto God once for all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 10. Reade the 9. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Heb.</hi> In a word, the whole redounds to this much, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which they offered up yeare by yeare continually under the Law, could not make the commers thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as pertaining to the Conſcience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2. Nay, could not ſo much as make him that did the ſervice perfect. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9. But the ſacrifice of Chriſts body once for all, makes the commers thereunto perfect, as pertaining to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.

                     </gap> better Covenant, than <hi>Moſes</hi> was. But the people to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:125778:58"/>whom <hi>Paul</hi> writes this Epiſtle, and the end wherefore he wrote it, are alwayes to be remembred; and that will give a great deale of light unto what is herein written.</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> If this be the meaning of the text, then here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in peculiar attributed to this miniſtration under the Goſpell; for under the Law the Elect were converted, and had their hearts changed, and renewed by Chriſt, and in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Right. They had ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grant but this, and grant my concluſion, and ſo eſtabliſh the contradictory of your owne. For if Chriſt made the ordinances of Grace effectuall to the converſion of Gods Elect under the Law, and doth the ſame under the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then that and this is the ſame Covenant of Grace for ſubſtance; and ſo the difference muſt needs lye in the adminiſtration onely. But <hi>Pauls</hi> controverſie lay with the Jewes, and mine lyes with the Anabaptiſts, both adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to Chriſt and his Goſpell. The converſion of the Jews under the Law is not to be aſcribed unto thoſe typicall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, but unto Chriſt, which they did typifie: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Gods Elect under the Goſpell, is to be aſcribed unto the ſacrifice of Chriſt, the Captaine of our Salvation, as the proper cauſe thereof. The Law ſaid, Chriſt is to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed; the Goſpell ſayes, Chriſt is ſacrificed for us: And they both beſpake the ſame Chriſt for the ſpirituall benefit of the worſhippers; yet the Goſpell-miniſtration is to have the prerogative, for now our High-prieſt is more excellent. Now we have a clearer manifeſtation of Gods love for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſity of the ſoule. Now we have a Throne of Grace to goe to, every where. Now wee have free acceſſe unto God, without bringing our ſacrifices unto others, who muſt (as types) offer them unto God for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The old Covenant (in the ſacrifices thereof) did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine call to remembrance the ſinnes of the worſhippers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very yeare, and ſo could not make the commers thereunto perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.3, 4. The new Covenant (in the ſacrifice thereof) doth wrap up the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:125778:59"/>ſinnes of the commers thereunto in perpetuall oblivion, and makes the worſhippers perfect, as pertaining to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24, 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15. And ſo now every worſhipper hath boldneſſe to enter into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt by this one ſacrifice, and to draw neare unto God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 22. And for this cauſe the typicall miniſtration muſt needs be inferiour, and the Goſpell miniſtration more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſublime, and anagogicall. Let theſe things be but ſeriouſly conſidered, and they will affoord you a great deale of light in reading that glorious Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And in a word, grant me that Gods Elect under the Law were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Gods free grace in jeſus Chriſt, in thoſe ſacrifices ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified, as (if there be any ſparke of ingenuity left in you) you muſt needs acknowledge, and you ſhall grant that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and this under the Goſpell, to be all one for ſubſtance; and ſo the difference betweene that and this to lye in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration onely. But how ſay you that this Goſpell-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is eſtabliſhed to better ſubjects? I pray, how better ſubjects? you ſay beleevers. But did God ſeale his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the Law to unbeleevers? How prove you that? To children in their infancy, therefore to unbeleevers. The inference is unſound, neither can you bring one text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where it's ſaid, that Infants of Jewes in Covenant were unbeleevers: And therefore let all men ſee how well your Divinity agrees with the language of Scripture. If the Scripture termes infants of the Jewes the holy ſeed, then they are not to be termed unbeleevers; and therefore you ſpeake wickedly, and more than you can juſtifie. Turne your Bible over, and by finding nothing for your purpoſe, you ſhall ſee that you have ſaid nothing to the purpoſe. That unbeleevers might have the ſigne of Circumciſion under the Law! Oh abominable blaſphemy! And the promiſes under the Goſpell doe no more belong to beleevers, than they did to beleevers under the Law. They did and doe belong to Gods people in Covenant. And infants of baptized parents are under the promiſe, and in Govenant.</p>

For if the certaine knowledge of a perſons election muſt bee the ground of baptizing unto us, then you ſhall never baptize any, but every particular perſon muſt baptize himſelfe: For no man by <hi>ordinary grace</hi> can have certaine knowledge of another mans election. But you will ſay, that albeit wee know, that there bee many reprobates borne within the Church, and many hypocrites may make a ſhew of faith by profeſſion (and not have it in truth) yet when they come one and one unto us by profeſſion of faith, we have a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perſwaſion that this and that man ſo profeſſing is of Gods election. And ſo ſay wee, that albeit wee know <hi>doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> that diverſe Infants borne within the Church are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, yet as they come to us one and one upon the evidence of Gods Covenant engraven upon them by birth, wee have a charitable perſwaſion that this and that Infant is of Gods election.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Why then doe you not baptize the Infants of thoſe that are without the Church, as Turks and Inſidels, if a charitable perſwaſion of Gods election be warrant enough for you?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> We anſwer, that ſuch Infants are not borne under the Covenant, neither are their parents under the ſeale of Baptiſine, and the Scripture no where termes ſuch Infants holy, as it doth every where the children of the Church. And this is a direct anſwer unto <hi>A. R.</hi> in the 6. page of his childiſh book, entituled the <hi>vanity of childiſh Baptiſme.</hi> The Adoption belongs to the children of the Church, and not to the children of aliens. And therefore this prophane Aſſe ſpeaks wickedly in his † moſt ferious thoughts <hi>What</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>if it be a warrantable ground for us to adminiſter Baptiſme to all Infants, becauſe that ſome particular Infants are elected, by the ſame reaſon it will follow, that Baptiſme may lawfully be adminiſtred to every man and woman in the world becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them alſo wee may judge that ſome are elected.</hi> page 6.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:125778:60"/>Theſe ſtout words of his doe as well beare before them a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed quarrell againſt God for Circumciſion, as againſt us for Baptiſme. Why might not ſuch an <hi>helliſh blasphemer</hi> ſay unto God. What? If it be a warrantable ground for us, to adminiſter circumciſion to all Male-Infants of Jewes, becauſe ſome particular Infants of them are elected, then by the ſame reaſon it will follow, that circumciſion may lawfully bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto every Male in the world, becauſe among them alſo we may judge that ſome are elected; why then doeſt thou not command circumciſion to be adminiſtred unto them alſo? Surely to this God would ſay, thus; <hi>viz.</hi> If any among other nations in the world, doe belong unto Mine election, they ſhall become Proſelytes unto the Church, and come in by profeſſion in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but when theſe Proſelytes are put under my ſeale, their Infants ſhall be circumciſed in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, though moſt of them be reprobates. And ſo ſay wee, if there be any of Gods elect among the aliens, they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Proſelytes to the Chriſtian Church, and ſo be baptized upon the confeſsion of their faith in Chriſt, but for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of thoſe Chriſtian Proſelytes, they ſhall all bee baptized in their infancy, as the children of the Covenant, though moſt of them may be reprobates, <hi>election</hi> and <hi>reprobation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the ground of our miniſtration or not miniſtration, but the Covenant under which perſons are borne. And thus you may ſee how wildly this Aſſe doth reaſon, and yet what a great ſhew doth he make of his Greek. But if he be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this pamphlet, that ſome report to be, then to my knowledge, he is not overſtored either with Greek or Latin.

And ſo likewiſe of the Gentiles, the Promiſe of the Covenant did belong unto the Gentiles too, as well as to the Jewes, yet I find not one example in all the book of God, where Jew or Gentile was baptized, but only upon their confeſſion of Chriſt, and beleeving the Gospell. So that ſuppoſe wee grant you, as much as you deſire, which is, that we are under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet this is not ſufficient to give us proper right unto the ſeales and priviledges of the Covenant, untill wee come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and confeſſe Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

And for you to take your turnes, and goe on in courſe, as if it were a buſineſſe for every Pedlar, and Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:125778:62"/>lour, and Felt-monger to meddle with, argues clearely that you were never men of Gods ſending, but have your Commiſſion from the devill, and not from Chriſt (as we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.) And now you tell me a tale of a Tub, that you derive your Commiſſion from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. where you ſay, that Chriſt bids His Diſciples to teach all nations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whatſoever He commanded them. Where you would lay this foundation, <hi>namely,</hi> that if a man be a Diſciple, then he may teach and baptize, and ſo the Miniſteriall function ſhall be no peculiar function. But if you look back upon the 16 verſe of that chapter you ſhall ſinde, that the Diſciples unto which Chriſt gave this Commiſſion, were the eleven Apoſtles, called there by the name of the eleven Diſciples. And therefore you belie the Lord, and pervert <hi>His</hi> word. And then you ſhuffle in your owne confuſions and gloſſes, as whatſoever the Apoſtles did in their miniſtration, all ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Churches, and Miniſters muſt doe, which is moſt falſe and impious.

For all that you can conclude from the 20. verſe, of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. (which is, teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whatſoever I command you) redoundes only to this. <hi>viz.</hi> Teach them to obſerve whatſoever I command you to teach them: but not to this, <hi>viz.</hi> Teach them to obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you to doe in your extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and Apoſtolicall miniſtration, that command them to doe in their ordinary, and paſtorall miniſtration. And yet your ſtrict urging of the letter will neceſſarily redound to this, and ſo every ordinary Miniſter muſt plant foundations, have an unerring ſpirit, deliver a new canon of divine faith, and worſhip, and confirme their doctrine by miracles. And thus you ſee, how for want of diſtinguiſhing you bring your

As for the controverſie of the calling of Miniſters, you may read <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> againſt <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and the Authour of the book entituled the unreaſonableneſſe of the ſeparation, a very precious book wherein <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> deceaſed is vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated againſt the calumnies of <hi>Can</hi> the <hi>Browniſt.</hi> Alſo two worthy treatiſes of famous M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And therefore for <hi>A. R.</hi> to ſpeak at randome, without refutation of theſe Authors, argues his purpoſe rather to calumniate, then to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſie and certifie conſcience. But to leave this <hi>ſenſeleſſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> either to repentance, or to the judgement of the great day, I return to you againe. I tell you that all your redarguti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are rather confirmations, then refutations unto me. And what miſery is this; All the ableſt Miniſters in the land, are of my judgement about this point of paedo-baptiſme, that the Prophecie of <hi>Clem. Writer</hi> the Factour might be fulfilled, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that it's thought that Miniſters ſhould be the laſt men, in the Church of England, unto whom God would reveale this your light.</hi> And his reaſon is a very materiall one, becauſe (ſaid he) <hi>they know this light, but doe hide it from the people, and will not hold it forth unto them.</hi> But to proceed. A child (ſay you) is not capable of the ordinary meanes of ſalvation. as the word and Sacraments. I anſwer, that a child indeed is not capable of Baptiſmall entrance into the Church by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:125778:65"/>but what? Therefore not at all. I deny that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, for there is another way of baptiſmall entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and that is by birth as a Chriſtian-borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe borne of baptized parents: and of this baptiſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance a childe is capable. Thus you ſeeme to argue: <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>This is your naturall ſophiſtry, and both propoſitions are unſound, and liable to juſt exception. But to the <hi>major,</hi> we ſay, that the Word and Sacraments are not the onely ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes of ſalvation; for there is Chriſt and the Spirit of Grace, which are ordinary meanes of ſalvation alſo. And elect infants that die unbaptized, are ſaved by Chriſt, and the Spirit of Grace. There are internall-ordinary means of ſalvation, as well as externall-ordinary means of ſalvation. And therefore, though your Logicke hath made fooles of your ſelves, yet it cannot make fooles of us. Thus we argue againſt your Paralogiſme and wicked fallacy, and we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you to anſwer us: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Chriſt and the Spirit of Grace are ordinary meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</item>

                     </item>
                     <item>Elect infants that die unbaptized, the ſaved by ordinary meanes of ſalvation.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Let elect infants die unbaptized, yet they are ſaved by Chriſt and the Spirit of Grace, and ſo (by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) by ordinary meanes of ſalvation. There is no falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:125778:65"/>nor ſophiſtry in this Syllogiſme, and both propoſitions are undenyable; and we need no ſuch ſhifts to maintaine Gods truthes as you have, to put a colour upon your hereſies. And this takes away your thicke covering, whereby you went about to darken knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Againe you ſay, that an elect infant can have no faith wrought by the ordinary means: And this aſſertion is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del too, upon a falſe ſuppoſition; for the outward ordinary meanes of faith are not the onely ordinary meanes of faith. An elect infant may have faith by Chriſt, the Author of faith; and by the Spirit of Grace, the Spirit of faith; and Chriſt and the Spirit are ordinary meanes of faith. And of availe too, when the outward are wanting. But the outward are of no availe, where theſe are wanting. And that an elect infant that dies unbaptized hath faith, may thus be evinced. You ſay, That without faith we cannot pleaſe God, then ſuch as pleaſe God have faith. Thus I argue then: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The propoſition (I ſuppoſe) you will not gain-ſay; the aſſumption haply you require me to make good. Thus then I prove it: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Such as goe to heaven, and are ſaved, doe pleaſe God.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>But haply you doe not ſo much deny their having of faith, as their having of faith by ordinary meanes. That then I thus evince: <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Your ſecond queſtion is, <hi>What Infants doe receive in Baptiſme?</hi> Which queſtion <hi>(as propounded by an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt)</hi> implyes this blaſphemy: <hi>viz.</hi> That Infants receive no benefit by baptiſme. But unto this quaere we ſay, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Chriſtians, by baptiſme have the Covenant put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeale unto them, as their native priviledge. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under which they were borne, makes them holy by birth. And Baptiſme under the Goſpell is the initiall ſeale of that holy Covenant. A ſeale by divine inſtitution annexed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:125778:68"/>unto that holy Covenant. And unto this determination we deſire either your brotherly ſubſcription, or rationall diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Your third and laſt is, <hi>Why, and to what end we bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Infants?</hi> And this is anſwered already, as in all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſo in our anſwers to your two former queſtions. But further we ſay, 1. That infants of Chriſtians are part of Gods portion and inheritance, and therefore we will not let them lie in the curſed condition of aliens, but ſeale them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods peculiar. For it were ſacriledge to make thoſe common, and uncleane, which God hath ſet apart unto himſelfe as holy. 2. For the childrens good we conſecrate them unto Gods care, by baptizing them into the name of the ſacred Trinity. God the Father is now their father, and they are his children: God the Sonne is their Saviour, and they are his members: God the Holy Ghoſt is their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier, and they are his Temple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But you ſay, that the Covenant made them ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> True, and baptiſme is nothing but a putting of the Covenant under ſeale unto them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But you baptize all without difference; if you bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized onely the elect, the matter were more tolerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Though diverſe borne within the Church are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, yet as they come one and one unto us, we cannot ſay, that this or that childe is a reprobate: Hee may be an elect veſſell for ought we know. And the adaequate end of baptiſme adminiſtred, is not ſalvation of the baptized. The glory of God is the principall end, namely the glory of Gods ſingular mercy in the ſalvation of his elect; and the glory of Gods Juſtice in the unexcuſe of the reprobate, as <hi>all outward miniſtrations in the Church ſerve for the glory of Gods mercy and juſtice.</hi> We put them all under the initiall ſeale of the Goſpell, that they may be made ſubject to the Goſpell, and be judged by the Goſpell. For the ſecret of election and reprobation we leave that unto God. Their being borne
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:125778:68"/>under the holy Covenant, is ſufficient to warrant our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. And to know who are elect, and who are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, is no more needfull to the miniſtration of baptiſme, than it was to the miniſtration of circumciſion among the Jewes; that being the initiall ſeale of the ſame holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto them, as baptiſme is now unto us. For they by circumciſion were incorporated into Chriſt to come, by that type of Chriſt upon their fleſh, and we by baptiſme are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into Chriſt already come. And by our being waſhed with water in baptiſme, we are aſſured that Chriſt hath ſhed his bloud to waſh away our ſinnes, and to make us cleane in Gods ſight, and that that Jeſus the Sonne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which the Jewes put to death under <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> (and hanged him on a tree) was the very Chriſt, and that we doe depend on him alone for Salvation, and doe looke for no other Saviour. And now becauſe you boaſt of a new light, which God in former ages hath not held forth to his Church, haply by this light you may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> argument againſt re-baptizing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, which none of your ſide could ever anſwer hitherto to this day. You ſay wee have no true baptiſme in our Church, becauſe our baptiſme is adminiſtred alwayes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their infancy. If no Baptiſme, then no Church, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, &amp;c.</hi> But to apply his argument to our Church againſt you Donatiſts. If there be no Baptiſme in our Church, then no Church; if no Church, then whence had you your Church and Baptiſme. Shew us your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſet up a new Church, and Baptiſme new. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that your <hi>A. R.</hi> a man ſo throughly verſed in the Fathers (as he would make his reader beleive. page 2.) had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed this knot. To ſay that Chriſt the head may be without a body for ſome time in this world, is Arminianiſme. For if the Church, and with it Baptiſme was loſt, then for that time Chriſt had no body in this world. And to ſay that the Church was loſt here, and not ſhew that you have derived your Commiſſion elſe-where, is to ſpeake abſurdly, and to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:125778:69"/>deale wickedly. Shew out of Gods Word your Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, I ſay not to baptize beleevers, and perſons growne up, but to baptize at all: Which Commiſſion untill you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, I ſhall conclude that you are rather infatuated by the Devill, than inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt. And now if you can reply any thing materiall, you ſhall (by Gods helpe) be anſwered. But for your giddy foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and idle non-ſenſe, I ſhall throw it aſide among my waſte papers.</p>
