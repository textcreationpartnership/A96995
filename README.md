1. THE COVENANTS Plea for INFANTS.
Anabaptiſt.ABriefe anſwer unto Mr WYNNNELS arguments, and reaſons that hee delivered in publique, foAnabaptiſt. Becauſe you ſay that children are holy, therefore they may be baptized, 1 Cor. 7.14. NowAnabaptiſt. If you ſay an inward holineſſe, then grace muſt come ſucceſſively from parents. And ſo bAnabaptiſt.Againe, if this be true then the unbelieving wife is made holy too, and ſhee may be baptiAnabaptiſt.But you ſay it is ſuch an holineſſe as hath the promiſes of the Kingdome of heaven. If ſoAnſwer.But we affirme, that the Apoſtle doth not speak of ſuch an holineſſe
in that place, but of ſuAnabaptiſt.For we have examples in Scripture, where children that are borne of two parents that wereAnabaptiſt.Againe, we doe not find any warrant in Scripture for to give the ſeales of the Covenant oAnabaptiſt.Againe, the Apoſtle doth not ſo much as any way make mention of baptiſme in that place. vAnabaptiſt.Againe, you parallell this place with Rom. 11.16. where you ſay, that is the root be holyAnabaptiſt.Againe your ſecond reaſon is, that children are capable of Baptiſine, and your ground is Anabaptiſt.But we deny the ſufficiency of this reaſon to prove Infants Baptiſme, and that upon this Anabaptiſt.Secondly, they differ in the ſignes, for the ſigne of circumciſion was the cutting off ofAnabaptiſt.Thirdly, they differ in the ſubjects, for the ſubjects of circumciſion were all Abrahams Anabaptiſt. Againe, the Infants might be more capable of circumciſion in their infancy, then when thAnabaptiſt.Againe there is difference in the perſons, for there were none but males circumciſed, butAnabaptiſt.Further they differ in the time, for they were to bee circumtiſed the eighth day, but we Anabaptiſt.Thirdly, you ſeeme to draw a reaſon from divine Authority
for Infants baptiſme, and you ſAnabaptiſt.But however, if this anſwer will not ſerve to confute your ſeeming reaſon, yet here is anAnabaptiſt.Againe, you doe plainly deſerve, Mt Wynnell, to have the ſame ſcandalous terme caſt upon Anabaptiſt.Nay further, you affirmed diverſe times over, that conſidering the eſtate and condition oAnabaptiſt.Againe, we may caſily ſee this overthrowne by other Scriptures, as Mar. 16.15, 16. There Anabaptiſt.Againe, if this Commiſſion had been from divine authority,
then the Apoſtles had not dareAnabaptiſt.Againe, further you ſay that this Commiſſion was partly circumſtantiall, as for to goe frAnabaptiſt.Nay further you grant us, that Baptiſme hath its Commiſſion from this text. Why then wee Anabaptiſt.Nay further thoſe to whom Chriſt gave this Commiſsion unto, He ſaid He would be with themAnabaptiſt.Fourthly you reaſon from the fruites and effects of Baptiſme, ſaying, that God did ordinaAnabaptiſt.You ſay it is effectuall, but we would know wherein it doth appeare, for we find generallAnabaptiſt.And this they dee ſtill remaine untill the word of God doth work upon them, and new mouldAnabaptiſt.For wee finde them to ſhew forth as bad fruites after their Baptiſme, as the vileſt creatAnabaptiſt.Againe, God ſuffered the Patriarches to live in the ſinne of malignity for a time, througAnabaptiſt.Againe you condemne many groſſe things, that have been practiced in the Church of EnglandAnabaptiſt.Further you bring us the example of wiſe and learned men which doe hold for Infants BaptiAnabaptiſt.Alſo you bring the practiſe of true Churches againſt us, but this argument is as weake asAnabaptiſt.Againe, there is as much controverſie among you Miniſters, concerning who ſhould be baptiAnabaptiſtAgaine, you alleadge the qualiſications of ſome men that hold againſt as, which (you ſay) Anabaptiſt.Nay you ſaid further, that they were as humble as the proudeſt Anabaptiſt of them all. NoAnabaptiſt.Further you demand of us, where we can bring any example of any Church gathered, that didAnabaptiſt.Next you ſeem to ſay ſomething concerning the Covenant, and you bring us the example of tAnabaptiſt.Further, you would know whether the Covenant be not ſociall; we anſwer, that it's ſociallAnabaptiſt.But the ſeales and peculiar priviledges belong only to beleevers. Gal. 3.22. Rom. 4.13, 1Anabaptiſt.For the Covenant is now eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, Heb 8.6. and to better ſubjectsAnabaptiſt.Againe, their being under the Covenant is not ſufficient to give them the ſeale of BaptiſAnabaptiſt.Againe, you demand further of the Anabaptiſts, where their Commiſſion is to baptize. As fAnabaptiſt.Further you affirmed in your firſt Sermon, that whatſoever was ſet up as an ordinance, inAnabaptiſt.If you aske, what become of Infants in the ſtate of infancy, if they dye before Baptiſme,Anabaptiſt.And thus we have runne over your chiefeſt arguments, at briefe as we could. We deſire youAnabaptiſt.And thus we deſire the Lord to adde his bleſſing to our weake endeavours, as to perſwade Anabaptiſt.Firſt you argue from the difference of ſtate and time of the Pagan. Gentiles in the ApoſtAnabaptiſt. Becauſe you ſay that children are holy, therefore they may be baptized, 1 Cor. 7.14. NowAnabaptiſt. If you ſay an inward holineſſe, then grace muſt come ſucceſſively from parents.

And ſo bAnabaptiſt.Againe, if this be true then the unbelieving wife is made holy too, and ſhee may be baptiAnabaptiſt.But you ſay it is ſuch an holineſſe as hath the promiſes of the Kingdome of heaven. If ſoAnſwer.But we affirme, that the Apoſtle doth not speak of ſuch an holineſſe
in that place, but of ſuAnabaptiſt.For we have examples in Scripture, where children that are borne of two parents that wereAnabaptiſt.Againe, we doe not find any warrant in Scripture for to give the ſeales of the Covenant oAnabaptiſt.Againe, the Apoſtle doth not ſo much as any way make mention of baptiſme in that place. vAnabaptiſt.Againe, you parallell this place with Rom. 11.16. where you ſay, that is the root be holyAnabaptiſt.Againe your ſecond reaſon is, that children are capable of Baptiſine, and your ground is Anabaptiſt.But we deny the ſufficiency of this reaſon to prove Infants Baptiſme, and that upon this Anabaptiſt.Secondly, they differ in the ſignes, for the ſigne of circumciſion was the cutting off ofAnabaptiſt.Thirdly, they differ in the ſubjects, for the ſubjects of circumciſion were all Abrahams Anabaptiſt. Againe, the Infants might be more capable of circumciſion in their infancy, then when thAnabaptiſt.Againe there is difference in the perſons, for there were none but males circumciſed, butAnabaptiſt.Further they differ in the time, for they were to bee circumtiſed the eighth day, but we Anabaptiſt.Thirdly, you ſeeme to draw a reaſon from divine Authority
for Infants baptiſme, and you ſAnabaptiſt.But however, if this anſwer will not ſerve to confute your ſeeming reaſon, yet here is anAnabaptiſt.Againe, you doe plainly deſerve, Mt Wynnell, to have the ſame ſcandalous terme caſt upon Anabaptiſt.Nay further, you affirmed diverſe times over, that conſidering the eſtate and condition oAnabaptiſt.Againe, we may caſily ſee this overthrowne by other Scriptures, as Mar. 16.15, 16. There Anabaptiſt.Againe, if this Commiſſion had been from divine authority,
then the Apoſtles had not dareAnabaptiſt.Againe, further you ſay that this Commiſſion was partly circumſtantiall, as for to goe frAnabaptiſt.Nay further you grant us, that Baptiſme hath its Commiſſion from this text. Why then wee Anabaptiſt.Nay further thoſe to whom Chriſt gave this Commiſsion unto, He ſaid He would be with themAnabaptiſt.Fourthly you reaſon from the fruites and effects of Baptiſme, ſaying, that God did ordinaAnabaptiſt.You ſay it is effectuall, but we would know wherein it doth appeare, for we find generallAnabaptiſt.And this they dee ſtill remaine untill the word of God doth work upon them, and new mouldAnabaptiſt.For wee finde them to ſhew forth as bad fruites after their Baptiſme, as the vileſt creatAnabaptiſt.Againe, God ſuffered the Patriarches to live in the ſinne of malignity for a time, througAnabaptiſt.Againe you condemne many groſſe things, that have been practiced in the Church of EnglandAnabaptiſt.Further you bring us the example of wiſe and learned men which doe hold for Infants BaptiAnabaptiſt.Alſo you bring the practiſe of true Churches againſt us, but this argument is as weake asAnabaptiſt.Againe, there is as much controverſie among you Miniſters, concerning who ſhould be baptiAnabaptiſtAgaine, you alleadge the qualiſications of ſome men that hold againſt as, which (you ſay) Anabaptiſt.Nay you ſaid further, that they were as humble as the proudeſt Anabaptiſt of them all. NoAnabaptiſt.Further you demand of us, where we can bring any example of any Church gathered, that didAnabaptiſt.Next you ſeem to ſay ſomething concerning the Covenant, and you bring us the example of tAnabaptiſt.Further, you would know whether the Covenant be not ſociall; we anſwer, that it's ſociallAnabaptiſt.But the ſeales and peculiar priviledges belong only to beleevers. Gal. 3.22. Rom. 4.13, 1Anabaptiſt.For the Covenant is now eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, Heb 8.6. and to better ſubjectsAnabaptiſt.Againe, their being under the Covenant is not ſufficient to give them the ſeale of BaptiſAnabaptiſt.Againe, you demand further of the Anabaptiſts, where their Commiſſion is to baptize. As fAnabaptiſt.Further you affirmed in your firſt Sermon, that whatſoever was ſet up as an ordinance, inAnabaptiſt.If you aske, what become of Infants in the ſtate of infancy, if they dye before Baptiſme,Anabaptiſt.And thus we have runne over your chiefeſt arguments, at briefe as we could. We deſire youAnabaptiſt.And thus we deſire the Lord to adde his bleſſing to our weake endeavours, as to perſwade
